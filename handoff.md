# Nidavellir — Session Handoff

## LATEST — run f2-forge-1790936118478 analysed (2026-10-02)

The first search-11 Clean run finished: Godforge 1890@937, Brokkr's 1800@875 (the user's stable
point) and Deep Calm 1710@825. Details are in memory.md.
- **Not exercised:** console mode, auto-resume off. The last-level TDR became BSOD 0x116 at 13:01,
  and the run waited 2 h 20 min for the user.
- **Done 2026-10-02, uncommitted; see decisions.md:**
  - Sentinel-cancelled TDR = `tdr_edge`.
  - UI declutter in all three themes.
  - Sentinel summary fix ("undefined MHz").
  - Validation: Rust 725/3 ignored, release build clean, UI unit 18/18 + build, e2e 37/37
    (three new UX tests).
  - Safety audit GO; the shutdown-aware wait nit was applied.
- **Next:** a run with `dev-service-boot.ps1 -Action Install` and auto-resume on.
- **Open UI ideas:**
  - The Instrument theme puts the primary action at the bottom below 1380 px.
  - Portuguese UI.
  - Dead panels can go in the code cleanup:
    - nothing imports `PowerSweepPanel` (→ `ProfileCards` → `StatusBadge`), `DiagnosticsPanel` or
      `VfCurvePanel` (→ `VfChart`);
    - the Dashboard and SafeLoop views are unreachable (no nav after onboarding).
- **Field validation:** Godforge 1890@937 and Deep Calm 1710@825 in games, with Safe Loop.

## Previous — TDR autonomy (2026-10-01 c), branch `forge-tdr-autonomy-2026-10-01`

The user wants an overnight run to finish with nobody logged in, even through recoverable TDRs. See
decisions.md 2026-10-01 (c).
- **Implemented, uncommitted:**
  - per-run TDR ceiling 6;
  - opt-in auto-resume (`SetForgeAutoResume`, UI checkbox with countdown);
  - experimental driver-only reset in the installed service (`auto_resume.rs`, `service_impl.rs`
    hook, startup latch skip in `tdr_sentinel.rs`);
  - stock-drift stop on Resume (60 MHz);
  - SCM recovery in `service-lifecycle.ps1`;
  - `scripts/dev-service-boot.ps1`;
  - `dev-launch.bat` uses a registered service.
- **Validation:**
  - Rust 724 pass / 3 ignored, release build clean, UI 18/18 + build, installer lifecycle test
    passes (sc.exe mocked).
  - Nothing ran on hardware.
- **Safety audit: GO with nits.**
  - Fixed: auto-resume acknowledges only the exact incident id it read (compare-and-ack); a Resume
    refused after the acknowledgement gets no second countdown.
  - Open:
    - `gpu_driver_reset.json` shares the ProgramData trust model (ACL hardening is a product item);
    - an installer run within ~5 s of a driver reset would see exit 1 and abort (fail-safe).
- **User test plan:**
  1. Elevated PowerShell: `scripts\dev-service-boot.ps1 -Action Install`.
  2. Run `dev-launch.bat`; it detects the service and opens the UI.
  3. Full Reset → Clean with "Continue on its own" checked.
- **Watch in the log:**
  - "Reset só do driver da GPU…", followed by a new countdown after the service returns;
  - otherwise, "Este boot ainda guarda o TDR… Reinicie o Windows".
  - `C:\ProgramData\Nidavellir\gpu_driver_reset.json` shows `covers_tdr` or `error`.
- **Uninstall the dev service:** `scripts\dev-service-boot.ps1 -Action Uninstall`. Data is kept.

## Previous — load steps + hot-bin anchor (2026-10-01, search 11)

The user's question was why the test failed 1815@887 once and then passed 881…843. See decisions.md
2026-10-01 (b).
- **Implemented:**
  - (a) Texture Hop r5 `load-step` phase, ExactApply39/Frontier34, lanes 138 s and screening
    34.5 s;
  - (b) `QualifiedHotBin`: a hot-bin-relieved anchor counts +10 mV, in the search (search 11) and
    the margin proof;
  - selection holds the one hot bin.
- **Validation:** Rust 721/3 ignored. Safety audit GO; its two nits (sliced load-step idle, stale
  "v29" log strings) are fixed.
- **TDR decisions (user, 2026-10-01):** implemented in 2026-10-01 (c) above.
- **Login PIN:** the installed service starts before login, so auto-resume needs no PIN there (lanes
  are headless, but a full Forge in session 0 is not validated yet). The dev BAT runs only after
  login.
- **Before updating:** the current run's profiles (ExactApply38) stop re-synthesizing after the
  update. Test 1815@881 in Overwatch first if wanted.

## Previous — selection holds the one hot bin (2026-10-01)

Run f2-forge-1790850465550 finished, but Brokkr's became 1905@931, Godforge's own clock, because of
a one-bin p5 dip. See decisions.md 2026-10-01.
- **Fix:** F2 selection treats a p5 in the held band as the target. New test
  `one_hot_bin_p5_dip_is_not_a_clock_trade`. Rust 717/3 ignored. Uncommitted.
- **After rebuild and service restart:** restore re-synthesis should show Godforge 1905@931,
  Brokkr's 1815@881 and Deep Calm 1725@831.
- **Before trusting Brokkr's:** validate 1815@881 in Overwatch with Safe Loop. It is 6 mV above the
  field crash at 1815@875.
- **Open:** retry a broken top measurement (1920@943, 71 W) once before descending a clock bin.

## Previous — three distinct profiles (2026-09-30, search 10)

Run f2-forge-1790761502529 is paused after a TDR at 1815@887. It lost Godforge 1905@937 to a false
p99 anomaly; see decisions.md 2026-09-30.
- **Implemented:**
  - p99 recheck only within 13 mV;
  - lower levels must end two steps below their start, else they retry up to two clock bins lower;
  - `no_distinct_profile`;
  - floors: Brokkr's 92%, Deep Calm 87%; Deep Calm draws less than Brokkr's;
  - attempt budget 30;
  - UI labels.
- **Validation:** Rust 716/3 ignored, release check clean, UI 18/18 + build. Uncommitted. Safety
  audit GO, no blockers.
- **Known limit:** if a retry's first pair is inconclusive (for example excluded by safety history),
  the level closes without a profile, even when the clock above had a weak one.
- **Next:**
  1. Reboot and acknowledge the incident. Do not Resume: v9 cannot resume under search 10.
  2. Rebuild with the BAT.
  3. Full Reset → Clean Run. The user always validates as a new user's first run, from zero
     evidence, so 1815@887 may TDR again and exercise the clock retry.
- **Expected:** Godforge 1905@937, Brokkr's ~1785–1800 @ 912–925, a lower Deep Calm; ~5–6 h.

## Previous — game-margin compensation (2026-09-29, search 9)

Godforge 1920@925 from the search-8 run TDR'd in Overwatch. The user's 1800@875 (stable) and
1815@875 (Overwatch crash) calibrate the matrix as ~6 bins lenient.
- Implemented, see decisions.md 2026-09-29:
  - 36 mV game margin for publication;
  - compensated top band with a verified margin pair;
  - −5%/−10% levels from the compensated top, two-bin steps;
  - balanced 2% lower-power tie rule;
  - restore re-synthesis, so a field failure drops only its own pair.
- Rust 712/3 ignored, release check clean, UI 18/18 + build. Uncommitted.
- **After reboot:** the current run re-synthesizes to 1830@893 for all profiles. Apply it and play
  with Safe Loop.
- **Next Clean Run:** expect Godforge ≈1890@937, Balanced ≈1800@881, Deep Calm ≈1710@~850.

## Previous — staircase descent + one hot bin + TDR pause/resume (2026-09-28)

Run f2-forge-1790617016985 qualified 1920@937 and then stopped at 931: a one-bin hot ClockDrop at
every clock. The user asked for a staircase.
- The top descends voltage to its first failure. The −5% and −10% levels start at the lowest
  passing voltage above them.
- One hot bin below target counts as held everywhere.
- A TDR at a level edge pauses for reboot + Resume. The crash budget no longer blocks Apply or
  publication.
- Versions: search 8, Discovery10/Frontier33/ExactApply38. See decisions.md 2026-09-28.
- Rust 708/3 ignored, release check clean, UI 18/18 + build. Uncommitted.
- Next: BAT rebuild, Full Reset → Clean.
  - Expected: a descent at 1920 below 937, then 1830 and 1740 levels.
  - On a TDR: reboot, acknowledge, then Retomar.

## Previous — paced light DX11 + contiguous batch credit (2026-09-27 c)

Run f2-forge-1790544997509 died on the first admission after discovery: DX11 light 6.5 s at target.
Per-batch clipping capped the ~8.7 ms light batches at ~18.5 s, and back-to-back light frames
were power-limited 65% of the time.
- Light phase paced at 50% duty with 2 lane shares (120 s).
- Coverage merges back-to-back batches of one phase.
- ExactApply37, dx11-game-v6.
- An Inconclusive unqualified top descends one clock bin at the same voltage, once per run,
  instead of ending the run (`inconclusive_descent_used`).
- Uncommitted.
- Next: BAT rebuild, Full Reset → Clean. Check the light phase's `target_active_us` in the DX11
  observation; the expected value is ~40–50 s.

## LATEST — margin probe last + light DX11 + diagnostics (2026-09-27 b)

Per user answers: margin probe runs last on a reserved admission and is not counted in the
integrity budget; DX11 lane adds a continuous light phase (own stock checksum, >=30 s exact target,
ExactApply36); phase metrics persist clock×temperature cells; `.gitattributes` added. Cool-down
before discovery was rejected (unrealistic). 706 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored, release
clean, UI 18/18 + build. Uncommitted. The light DX11 frame is untested on hardware: the ignored
`stock_golden_and_candidate_readback_are_stable` test covers it when run on the GPU.

## LATEST — thermal/margin package after Endurance stop (2026-09-27)

Run1790537155912 qualified 1920@937 through DX11/Vulkan/DX12 and stopped at Endurance
`thermal_clock_drop` (one-bin drop in hot near-limit phases + SW thermal bit refusing power-capped
samples). Implemented (no version bumps): one-bin heavy sustain, HW-only F2 thermal, Endurance hot
target coverage, publication margin + one top margin probe. 705 Rust tests passed/3 hardware
ignored, release check clean. Uncommitted. Next: BAT rebuild, Full Reset → Clean (~6.5 h), then
apply the chosen profile and play with Safe Loop active before accepting. See decisions.md 27/09.

## LATEST — publish after crash (B) + band-only inconclusive (2026-09-26 night)

User chose B: an attributed in-process CandidateCrash still stops the run, but the terminal close
publishes profiles from pairs with a complete current-run matrix after the condemnation is durable
and stock restored, excluding the recomputed TDR cone; Apply stays latched until the incident is
acknowledged (Recover Forge) and re-checks the cone. Bugcheck (process death) still publishes
nothing. Inconclusive now closes only its band; before a qualified top the search still ends.
702 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored, release check passed. No hardware, UI unchanged.
Next: user closes Core, BAT rebuild, Full Reset → Clean (~7 h).

## Previous — DX11 power-limit attribution fix (2026-09-26 night)

Run1790466472114 (search7) worked through discovery (1075→943→937) and the 30 s screening, then
stopped at DX11 `dx11_target_unexercised`: cap bit on 100% of samples but only 0.14 s credited,
because NVML power is a 1 s average on Ampere and the rule also demanded >=97% of limit per sample.
Fixed: power-limited = SW power-cap bit without thermal bit. 701 Rust tests passed/3 hardware
ignored. Crash-at-edge risk resolved by the entry above (option B).
Next: user closes Core, BAT rebuild, Full Reset → Clean; expect ~7 h for 24 admissions.

## Previous — representative-load contract + search7 (2026-09-26 evening)

User chose the representative load (PowerRender) as the power envelope; heavy matrix loads may
reach the 200 W limit. Frontier32/ExactApply35/search7 (Discovery9, matrix27 unchanged):
power-bound jumps to the lowest bin above the measured equilibrium voltage; qualification samples
below target with SW power cap (97% condition later removed) count as held; heavy phases <20 samples skipped
(fixes every 30 s screening going `heavy_phase_telemetry_low`); selection uses PowerRender p99.
Evidence and test log: target/beta/representative-load-20260926/. See memory.md Current and
qualification-rules-2026-09-25.md (new top section). No hardware run, reset or live change.
Next: user closes Core, rebuilds via scripts/dev-launch.bat, Full Reset → Clean; check the first
power-bound jump log line, the Texture screening verdict and DX11 `power_limited_active_ms`.

## Previous — nominal clock envelope (2026-09-26)

Run1790446614161 proves repeated1905->1920 excursions with voltage held1043 and no faults.
User rejects endless abort/retry; current contracts Discovery9/Frontier31/ExactApply34/search5
allow measured nominal..nominal+15MHz throughout discovery/heavy qualification. NVML request
remains nominal, voltage/power unchanged. Peak saved separately from p95; absent/out-of-range
peak cannot authorize current evidence. No higher profile inferred from transient peaks.
Snapshot/tests: target/beta/clock-envelope-20260926/. Hardware validation pending; no live
process stopped, reset or started. See memory.md Current and qualification-rules-2026-09-25.md.
697 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored; release cargo check and UI build passed. Core PID14884
still open: no new executable loaded. User closes Core and rebuilds through BAT for validation.

## Previous — control stop diagnosis and bounded recovery (2026-09-26)

Run f2-forge-1790445480585 correctly began1920@1081, stopped attempt9/24 at1920@1031
after a control excursion. No TDR/integrity fault; reset confirmed. Peak clock was not saved,
so exact overshoot is unknown. Search4 adds one durable same-pair discovery retry after clean
recovery, and explicit peak diagnostics; repeated control failure still stops. No hardware run
started/stopped. Core PID8152 still has old code; user closes it and rebuilds via BAT for new run.
Read memory.md Current and target/beta/control-stop-20260926/ for preserved evidence.
Verification:696 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored; release cargo check/UI build passed.
No new release executable loaded and no physical retry tested.

## Previous — organic top seed correction (2026-09-26)

- Root cause: f2_qualified_search_seeds limited target to preheat sustained p5, despite a higher
  stock VF domain. Removed that parameter; first target is the real domain maximum, not1740
  or a hardcoded1905. Voltage remains stock-derived with bounded offset planning.
- Search3 descends after an unavailable top; see memory.md and updated qualification rules.
  Existing hardware protections/qualification contracts unchanged. Search2 cannot Resume.
- 693 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored; logs under target/beta/top-seed-20260926/.
  Release replacement blocked by Windows access denied while Core PID22656 remained open.
  Live Core was not changed; stop run/close Core, then BAT rebuild is required before validation.
  No service start, stop, reset or physical test. Next: user new Core via BAT, Full Reset/Clean;
  inspect first-candidate log and real upper-domain evidence. Do not promise historical1905.

## Previous — worst-load qualification software validation (2026-09-25)

- Discovery8 / Frontier30 / ExactApply33 / search2. Only performance starts; complete pass raises
  clock first, power-bound descends voltage at same clock, economic seeds derive from qualified top.
- Maximum sampled clock (no +15 tolerance), voltage authority also on ClockDrop, all-lane power
  strictly below board cap; heavy DX11 phases each30s/95%, other heavy phases20samples/95%.
- Removed power-bound5% residency exception. Cancel preserves neutral status; telemetry stalls and
  current ClockDrop do not establish instability. Contaminated dwell faults skip nominal blacklist;
  independent Sentinel/BootFlag TDR protections still conservative and not automatically erased.
- See docs/qualification-rules-2026-09-25.md for full criteria, transitions and physical limitations.
-690 Rust tests passed/3 hardware ignored; final classifier recheck476 service tests passed.
 18 UI unit +6 qualification browser tests passed; Core release/UI production builds passed.
 Logs, hashes and backups: target/beta/worst-load-20260925/verification.json. No hardware run,
 service start, reset, acknowledgement or live tuning. Next: user-started Full Reset/Clean via
 scripts/dev-launch.bat, inspect heavy phase evidence/control refusals before accepting hardware.


## Previous — stopped run analyzed; top-first objective restored (2026-09-25)

Read memory.md Current and docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-25.md. User rejected low provisional
results. Evidence confirms no target above1740 was tested; performance band closed on missing
DX11 exposure, not hardware failure. Manual cancel wrongly closed balanced band too. Paused,
stock cleanup confirmed by checkpoint/observations; no new hardware action performed.
User requires highest qualified clock under board power budget first, then[90%,100%] profile
search. Current3-stock-band strategy misses that priority. No code changed in this review.
Power criterion answered: ALL loads including heaviest stress must sustain target below board
limit. Reduced-duty exposure alone cannot approve a top.1740@937 initial DX11 full-duty max1680.
Preserve integrity/recovery, redesign top-first scheduling and qualification contract together;
then derive[90%,100%] economic domain. Do not promise manual gaming clock under worst load.

## Previous — qualified discovery delivered; user-started clean run next (2026-09-24)

Read memory.md Current and docs/undervolt-discovery-proposal-2026-09-18.md. The implementation
is complete and software-tested: qualification-first3-band discovery,24 admissions/8h Standard,
full same-pair matrix before any refinement, durable limits/closed bands and one power-bound
preparation. No TDR Resume. Frontier29/ExactApply32. Stock secondary oracle/peer cancellation.
Old exhaustive frontier and vertical-repair code removed; no parallel old live algorithm remains.
UI separates short-stage success, complete candidate proof, coverage and budget/stop reasons.

Verification:692 workspace tests passed,3 hardware tests ignored;18 UI unit and33 browser cases
passed; Core release and UI production build passed. No Rust warnings. Logs and exact hashes:
target/beta/qualified-discovery-20260924/verification.json. Core is
 target/release/nidavellir-service.exe (12,672,512 bytes; SHA256 in verification file).
No service start, GPU load, reset, acknowledgement or installer operation. Review also fixed
Stop hiding integrity failure, global-vs-pair exclusions, exact-clock summaries and offset reference.

NEXT: user closes old UI/Core if open and launches scripts/dev-launch.bat, which rebuilds release;
Full Reset -> Clean Run manually, then exports report.8h run budget is independent of Codex quota.
Inspect first complete-pair time, total time, bands/stop reasons, errors/TDR, cleanup and profiles.
Do not call software tests physical acceptance; do not manufacture proof from the previous run or
restart an automatic crash campaign. Hardware/game and product/installer acceptance stay pending.

## Previous — stronger discovery design ready, implementation pending (2026-09-18)

Read docs/undervolt-discovery-proposal-2026-09-18.md. User requested a more trustworthy
triage/discovery design and accepts longer tests. Recommend few candidates qualified by
the existing full ordered matrix BEFORE further descent, with finite persistent budgets
and regional stops on integrity error.12 attempts/4h are pilot limits pending planner reach
replay, not stability thresholds or production defaults. Stock-derived bands allow one
bounded preparation step under confirmed power limitation. Do not treat a short pass as
qualification or assume user has accepted every numeric detail.
First fix secondary canary stock-reference and prompt error propagation: currently it
self-references at the candidate and reports its failure only after primary completion.
No proof either gap caused868's bugcheck.1890@875 passed only short tests; it is not a
demonstrated false pass. No source change, build, hardware test or state reset in this design
turn. Keep Full Reset forget-all, manual BAT validation and explicit incomplete coverage.

## Previous — manual Clean Run reboot investigated (2026-09-18 afternoon)

Read docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-18.md. Run1789720117824 failed in Texture Frontier at
1890@868: driver153 at05:47:34, durable CandidateCrash+Stop05:47:36, Windows bugcheck0x116
and nvlddmkm.sys attribution at next boot05:49. Stock cleanup for that transaction is NOT
confirmed; armed flag/checkpoint preserved. No current Core process.38 completed observations,
all their cleanups confirmed; no final Apply or profiles.1890@875 passed short tests only.
Investigation did not start Core, clear evidence, acknowledge, Resume or run GPU load. Dump
access denied, so no claimed blocked-call/stack diagnosis. Next: review cancellation/cleanup
after first TDR; distinguish detector recording success from actual driver recovery. Evidence:
target/beta/restart-investigation-20260918-151401/. Preserve before any operator Full Reset.

## Previous — four post-run corrections implemented; manual acceptance next (2026-09-18)

Read memory.md Current and docs/contracts/ui-backend.md first section. Source changes:
separate confirmed PowerRender comparison p99 from worst Apply stress p99; remove the common
1% F2 energy veto without changing board-limit programming or v31 physical qualification;
persist per-clock stop/censoring records; allow one economic-range extension based on final
Godforge sustained p5 with budget surviving Resume; deduplicate UI cards and disclose coverage.
Full Reset forgets everything as already implemented; Soft preserves negatives. No live reset.
725 workspace tests,18 UI unit tests,28 browser cases and production UI build passed;208 final
sweep tests passed after coverage/persistence refinements. Release cargo check passed; Clippy
completed with existing warnings.
Offline replay identifies9 clean DX11 passes that would continue; it cannot qualify their missing
API lanes. The3 target-unexercised cases remain refused. Evidence:target/beta/profile-policy-20260918/.
Core7696 was idle via read-only IPC and left untouched. It predates these source edits. User
should close UI/Core normally and reopen the BAT, which rebuilds release, then Full Reset ->
Clean Run manually. No hardware load, no service restart, no installer and no history erasure.
Release executable/sidecar not replaced in this turn; no need to install for BAT validation.
Inspect new run for actual trade-offs and incomplete/censored coverage before declaring quality
solved. No hardcoded manual reference, no automatic run and no unbounded extension.

## Previous — Full/Soft Reset implemented; build waiting on old Core (2026-09-17)

User explicitly changed reset policy: Full must forget all GPU knowledge INCLUDING negatives;
Soft must preserve known failures and clear positive results. This supersedes prior guidance.
Implementation in gpu_apply/ipc_server, additive ResetGpuTuningSoft IPC, UI confirmations and
BAT wording. Full deletes active stores/learning archives after stock/quiescence, clears RAM
results; a persistent pending marker blocks tuning/reapply until interrupted deletion is retried.
Reboot guards and development authorization remain. See contracts first section and decisions.
722 workspace tests,17 UI unit tests,25 browser journeys, Clippy and UI build passed. Hardware reset not executed;
user data unchanged. Evidence:target/beta/reset-modes-20260917/ (before/patches/logs).
BLOCKER: release executable is held by Core17032 (run finished, process remains). User asked
to close via async question. After exit: cargo build --release -p nidavellir-service, copy to
apps/ui/src-tauri/binaries/nidavellir-service-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe, verify hashes, update
manifest/status. Do not force kill, authorize a run or erase actual learning automatically.
Do not present profile optimization as solved; the other analysis findings still need correction.

## Previous — completed run produced one qualified point under three names (2026-09-17)

Read docs/profile-selection-analysis-2026-09-17.md and memory.md Current. Run1789668446810
finished after2h08;1710@868/196.668W passed all4 Apply lanes and was duplicated across profiles.
12 higher pairs exceeded the common198W ceiling;9 had passed DX11,3 also lacked exposure.
No active overshoot, physical failure or failed reset in this run. Profile quality remains open.
Primary chain: historical TDR cone censors lower voltages despite fresh-positive Clean -> different
PowerRender/DX11 power costs eliminate almost all Apply pairs -> original90%-of1890 floor at1710
leaves no lower economic alternatives -> synthesis aliases sole point as all3 qualified profiles.
1920@943 historical incident originated in restart reconciliation; audit its attribution and the
inferred cone, never silently erase negatives or assume removing one event permits1800@875.
Next corrections are in report; user requested analysis, no algorithm/history changes performed.
Evidence:target/beta/profile-selection-20260917/. New tests/build are unnecessary for this analysis.
No service running at collection, but post-run shutdown timing was not captured.

## Previous — delayed Core exit and NVAPI lifecycle correction (2026-09-17)

Read memory.md Current and docs/shutdown-investigation-2026-09-17.md. Old Core10272 remained
enumerated with one busy kernel thread more than3min after its clean marker, then exited itself.
No stack proves the exact kernel cause. Fixed repeated unbalanced NvAPI_Initialize calls in11
wrapper sites; one shared initialization and one terminal unload after GPU users quiesce.
719 workspace tests passed (3 hardware tests ignored); separately128 read-only voltage reads,
unload and subprocess exit passed in123.0905ms. Clippy/release passed; release/sidecar hashes match.
This build ALSO includes the preceding clock-control diagnostics/routing changes, previously
blocked from release replacement by the running Core. No service start or GPU workload executed.
Evidence:target/beta/shutdown-lag-20260917/. Next is bounded manual BAT/Clean Run acceptance,
including closing Core after the run. Do not claim the short probe proves full-run shutdown or
that clock containment is solved. Keep workload thresholds and negative safety evidence intact.

## Previous — clock-control diagnostics and bounded routing implemented (2026-09-17)

Read memory.md Current and docs/contracts/ui-backend.md first section. Upper excursions now
retain phase/time/voltage/temperature and optional post-query curve context, independently of
exposure/power refusals. Reset-clean complete lanes exclude only the pair as ClockControlExceeded;
one alternate, then stop if control violation recurs. Resume restores the budget from observations.
No blacklist/voltage escalation for control failure; physical/cleanup faults remain terminal.
717 workspace tests passed (2 hardware tests ignored), Clippy passed existing warnings. No tuned
workload or service restart. Evidence:target/beta/clock-control-20260917/. Service10272 still runs
the OLD release; no release/sidecar replacement. User BAT rebuilds after closing old service.
Physical ceiling cause remains unknown: no claim that software routing fixed driver containment.
Next bounded manual Clean Run should inspect the new diagnostics, not relax thresholds or repeat
blind overnight runs. 1% energy margin, DX11 workload and Apply v31 qualification rules unchanged.

## Previous — first DX11 v4 Clean Run analyzed (2026-09-17)

Read docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-17.md and memory.md Current. Run1789633001432 ended incomplete
after38m34s,54 observations, no new physical faults or failed cleanup, no definitive profiles.
1890@943 power refusal correctly moved to1875@937. That second pair met numeric active-exposure
requirements (30.007s/76.524s,39.21%) but exceeded1875 (aggregate max1890), terminating all search.
Both also exceed198W publication power ceiling. NVML max=target is ALREADY requested by the writer;
overshoot cause/duration/frequency are not recorded. Instrument effective control and introduce a
specific bounded decision for out-of-target control without instability attribution or silent pass.
Keep concurrent energy/coverage causes visible. Then bounded hardware acceptance, not another
blind overnight campaign. Analysis only; no source edits, restart, authorization or GPU load.
Evidence snapshots/hashes:target/beta/clean-run-20260917/. Service10272 still open at collection,
persisted run stopped; do not automatically Resume or change controls.

## Previous — DX11 v4 / exact Apply v31 implemented (2026-09-17)

Read memory.md Current and docs/contracts/ui-backend.md first section. Same total DX11 budget,
heavy opening/closing and variable middle phases; fenced GPU-work accounting excludes idle and
CPU checksum time. New active_target proof requires60 s observed active,30 s exact target,35%
target fraction, all phases, sane voltage <=anchor and no sampled upper work excursion.
Unexercised target excludes only that pair in the current run and moves to other candidates;
no voltage repair, physical failure inference or blacklist. Continuous-load power remains screened.
Publication requires current v31 active proof, negatives remain independent. Old structural repair
cannot ignore a predominantly asserted power-limit flag just because numeric watts are lower.
714 workspace tests passed (two hardware tests ignored); separate existing DX11 stock integration
passed in3.08 s. No tuned run executed. Evidence/before copies/build manifest:
target/beta/active-residency-20260916/. Next is bounded manual clean-start acceptance of active
exposure and eventual profiles; no blind overnight test or claim of hardware qualification.

## Previous — bounded load comparison executed (2026-09-16 22:15 local)

Read memory.md Current and the last section of docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-16.md.
One user-authorized 1830@943 transaction ran five 30 s DX11 duty phases without reapplying.
Residence at1830 went 1.01 ->42.23 ->63.39 ->78.42 ->0.68% as work duty went100/75/50/25/100.
All checks matched; stock cleanup confirmed, safety/observation files unchanged, paused checkpoint
restored exactly. Evidence/scripts/journal/summary: target/beta/load-comparison-20260916/.
Do not call this profile qualification: samples include idle; active-work exposure is not isolated.
Readback also caught a temporary15 MHz shift in base/live curve with unchanged offset.
506 service tests passed; release/sidecar rebuilt C5E5293E...EE9B0F, no service running.
No need to rerun this comparison automatically. Next implementation should separate heavy-load
integrity/performance from bounded active target coverage and fix numeric-off-cap interpretation.

## Previous — power fallback corrected after operator's loaded run (2026-09-16)

Read memory.md Current and docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-16.md final section. Run
f2-forge-1789586811426 is manually paused with confirmed stock cleanup. Collection now yielded
8 voltage samples in every short Discovery dwell. Seven DX11 dwells at 943 mV consumed 49 min
because Godforge repeatedly carried an energy-rejected voltage to the next lower clock as a
priority override. The fast-drop candidate now rejects ExactApplyPowerCeilingExceeded, leaving
normal synthesis to select independently discovered pairs. Physical-failure fallback is preserved.
505 service tests passed. Evidence, before source, tests and release-build.log are in
target/beta/power-routing-20260916/. No service restart, Resume or hardware write by Codex.
Release rebuild failed with access denied removing the executable held by service PID 20400;
sidecar unchanged. Close service normally before the next BAT rebuild; updated source is tested.
DX11 residency and full profile acceptance remain unresolved; do not treat this routing fix as
proof of the entire algorithm or ask for another blind overnight campaign.

## Previous — telemetry correction implemented, software verified (2026-09-16)

Read the current entry in memory.md and docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-16.md. The dwell now uses
persistent NVML and voltage attempts every 500 ms instead of every 16 inventory-reader loops.
The minimum voltage proof remains 3 reads. Specific inconclusive_reason reaches persisted
observations and both exports; non-power Discovery refusals no longer claim missing power.
Per-phase sample_count/clock_max record the coverage and excursions p95 can hide.

707 software tests passed; read-only host probe collected 8 voltage reads after the 6 s discard in
a 10 s window and 39–40 clock/power reads per 1.2 s. This is cadence evidence without GPU load,
not physical qualification. Evidence/before copies/final build manifest: target/beta/sampler-fix-20260916/.
No shader, search policy, clock/voltage pass threshold, contract version or safety history changed.

Next: bounded loaded verification of collection and investigate off-cap DX11 residency; do not
declare clock-ceiling containment or profile discovery solved, or recommend another blind overnight
run. Manual 1800@875 is a provisional comparator for this GPU only, not a search seed/forced result.
The operator owns the manual BAT/Full Reset/Clean launch. Old service 19348 remains present and
unresponsive to bounded Ping; the release file was built but that process was not restarted.

## Previous — overnight Clean Run reviewed; concrete sampling defect (2026-09-16 afternoon)

Read docs/clean-run-results-2026-09-16.md and the top of memory.md. Run
f2-forge-1789548115932 finished incomplete after 3h08: 103 observations, no profiles,
21 final DX11 Inconclusive; 17 power-envelope rejections behaved as intended.
13 Discovery/calibration Inconclusive all have only 1–2 voltage readings, while the
voltage-authority guard requires 3. Sampler reads voltage every 16 iterations; the 10 s
windows did not deliver enough evidence. The generic PowerTelemetryInconclusive label
hides this actual cause. Fix sampling/reason reporting before another long run, retaining
evidence requirements. Seven Frontier Texture boost_edge_telemetry_low cases also need review.
1710@868 remains an independent off-cap DX11 residency failure (1695 MHz p95 across 3 dwells).

No new incident, 75 C max, all resets/BootFlags clean, history unchanged. Source untouched
during this result review. Evidence preserved in target/beta/clean-run-20260916/; no new run
or authorization sent. Service 19348 is still present but IPC connection timed out twice;
the result is from final disk snapshots/audit. Do not claim the service exited, or silently
restart it. User owns the next manual BAT/Full Reset/Clean start. Heartbeat remains paused.

## Previous — operator launches everything with Desktop BAT (2026-09-16 08:35Z)

Do not launch a service/authorize/start on the operator's behalf for this attempt. He wants
the manual path through Desktop dev.bat → program Full Reset → Clean Run → Forge GPU.
Desktop dev.bat now delegates to scripts/dev-launch.bat, which opens UI BEFORE its explicit
authorization prompt. Operator resets in UI, returns to BAT to answer S, then starts Clean
in UI. The old BAT authorized first, causing exactly the permission-consumed-by-reset trap.
Original BAT backup/evidence: target/beta/overnight-run-20260916/. Procedure updated in
docs/development-validation.md. Readiness fragment parses; no live launcher execution yet.

Codex-prepared service 15504 stopped through Ctrl+C at 08:34:20Z, exit 0/clean marker confirmed.
No service/UI remains, no BootFlag/applied profile, safety hashes unchanged. No run was started.
The operator will launch and test the algorithm manually. Preserve the mixed tree, avoid builds
or service changes during his run, and inspect live state first on resumption. Heartbeat paused.

## Previous — overnight session prepared, later stopped for manual BAT launch (2026-09-16 08:28Z)

Operator now requires all new validations to start Full Reset → Clean Run, with zero reuse of
positive hardware learning. This is the primary acceptance path; Persistent/Resume cannot
substitute it. Real incident history remains a separate safety restriction on this used GPU.

The screenshot's block came from authorization followed by Full Reset before any Start,
not a new crash. Export/audit reviewed, hashes unchanged. Completed clean console shutdown
and restarted release service PID 15504 via wrapper 6140; existing UI stays open. Authorized
one new development Clean Run at 08:27:32Z (Standard timing). Latest check: running=false,
start_block_reason=null, idle stock, BootFlag false. Operator will click Forge GPU manually.
Do not repeat Reset/authorize/restart or rebuild during this session; inspect current state first.
Release remains 207C1EB6...2963BC. Evidence/logs: target/beta/overnight-run-20260916/.
No workload started by Codex and no scheduled monitoring enabled. Read the latest memory entry.

## Previous — DX11 v3 correction and bounded comparison complete (2026-09-16)

Read the current memory.md entry and docs/clean-run-investigation-2026-09-14.md first.
DX11 v3 overlaps one GPU batch with CPU checksum work. Exact Apply is v30, while the
CandidateCrash budget/cone/startup safety floor remains v29 to preserve negative history.
The SECOND AND FINAL diagnostic finished September 15 at 22:02:29Z, exit 0: 420 s at
1830 MHz / 943 mV, 261424 frames/16339 checks, +28.9% throughput, 199.911 W p99, 76 C max.
It remained Inconclusive (0.052% target residency). Both diagnostic windows are consumed;
do not relaunch the wrapper, run a third point or start a full Forge automatically.

After this physical comparison, the routing was fixed: complete clean DX11 above existing
99%-of-board publication headroom stops retries and remaining lanes, preserves its raw
Inconclusive, and closes same-clock upward-voltage repair. No blacklist/threshold relaxation.
This routing was tested offline against measured numbers; full-run hardware acceptance is open.
704 workspace tests passed, 2 hardware tests ignored; the real DX11 stock smoke passed
separately (bad render/compute goldens and mid-run cancellation included).

Final release: target/release/nidavellir-service.exe, SHA-256
207C1EB65863218C0088EF48FD8FD1BF13C6F55CB32F2BEAF041ED9DEC2963BC.
The physical comparison used pipeline build DFE3CBBF...61CC667 before the routing patch.
Evidence and both copied journals: target/beta/clean-run-20260914/. On September 16 the
service was absent, Safe Loop idle, pending incident null, BootFlag/applied profile absent,
and both Safe Loop and condemnation ledger matched their pre-run hashes. Heartbeat paused.

NEXT: operator's manual command-based run, using the current release and the explicit
development-validation workflow already documented. Verify early power rejection and a
complete four-lane profile result, or record the explained refusal. The comparison itself
did not approve any profile or finish product acceptance. Installer was not rebuilt.
Preserve the mixed worktree; audio is resolved and outside this task.

## Previous — first bounded point diagnostic (2026-09-15)

The September 14 Clean Run was stopped cooperatively; stock/idle verified, evidence
exported, development authorization consumed and monitoring heartbeat PAUSED. No current
service/workload after the operator's reboot. Read docs/clean-run-investigation-2026-09-14.md
and the latest memory.md entry before older run instructions below.

Confirmed: 39 exact-Apply DX11 attempts across 13 pairs were inconclusive due to target
residency (38 full attempts), with no recorded integrity/crash failure. The one newly
authorized point diagnostic then completed 120 s stock preheat plus a full 420 s dwell at
1830 MHz / 943 mV. It returned `Inconclusive: target_residency_low` at 5.253% residency
(35% required), 1767/1665/1785/1830 MHz avg/p5/p50/p95, and 98.07% power-capped fraction.
No integrity error, TDR or device loss occurred; reset succeeded and BootFlag cleared.
Readback showed the writer's +90 MHz anchor and effective 1830 MHz at 943/950 mV for all
42 dwell snapshots, so the planner's reproduced valley did not appear in the effective
curve. Working hypothesis is power/boost limitation under this workload; physical cause
remains unisolated. Production writer, qualification thresholds and negative history are
unchanged.
The paired comparison originally proposed here has now finished; use the current entry above.
The initial power/boost hypothesis based on the cap flag was too strong: p99 was 180.102 W.
Do not launch a full search or renew authorization automatically. Audio resolved/out of scope.

## START HERE — beta closure, intermittent execution (2026-09-12)

The current plan is `roadmap.md` (D1–D5, J01–J11); `product.md` is the frozen beta
contract. Resume from the latest `memory.md` entry and recheck files/processes after
an interruption. Older START-HERE entries below are historical and do not override
the current plan, Full Reset acknowledgement or the beta product contract.
No automatic wakeup or usage-reset redemption was requested. Preserve the mixed
worktree; hardware acceptance follows software gates and live safety eligibility.

Workflow update (2026-09-14): operator prefers command-based development, then a manual run
and later log analysis across quota windows. Use a release console service and ordinary-user
Tauri dev UI; freeze the code/processes during the run. Do not use scripts/dev.ps1's optional
cargo-watch service restart for acceptance. Installer checks resume for packaging changes or
the frozen release candidate. This discussion started no service/build/run and does not resolve
the existing 3/2 refusal; that remains the prerequisite for the proposed manual acceptance.

LATEST (2026-09-14 08:21Z): controlled development authorization implemented and verified offline.
Use docs/development-validation.md: elevated release console with --development-validation,
then scripts/authorize-validation.ps1 -Authorize -Reason and ordinary-user Tauri dev UI. Authorization
requires idle/recovered stock/no checkpoint, preserves historical exclusions and covers one fresh
Standard run only. Synced audit precedes claim/spawn; first new/changed crash or any termination
consumes permission. No Resume/Long/other GPU workers/Apply. Full Reset and process restart never
restore it automatically. Normal console/SCM remain on the original 3/2 budget.
700 Rust (498 service), 17 Node, 3 J12 theme tests, 4 isolated command scenarios, UI build and release
service passed. Evidence: target/beta/development-validation/. New release hash 4F48C611...828B5,
built 08:19:15Z; installer/old manifest/sidecar not rebuilt and not equivalent to this service.
No live authorization/reset/GPU run; safe data unchanged, no service/UI/tuning files. NEXT is the
operator's manual authorization and Standard run, then export/analysis. Do not auto-start a run.

Previous (2026-09-14 02:10Z): installed safety guidance/export/history PASSED with actual Tauri IPC
as an ordinary Windows user. Pinned installer 08937E75...80417; installed UI matches its extracted
payload. Safe Loop Protected, enabled Review safety block, real report with three acknowledged
incidents and direct Sentinel history navigation all verified. Native state remained idle/stock
with no pending ACK and the same 3/2 refusal. Normal close and checked uninstall passed.
Evidence: target/beta/installed-safety-guidance/session.json, ui-result.json, post-verification.json,
guidance.png/history.png and exported-diagnostic.txt. All 193 original data files retained; critical
Safe Loop/ledger hashes match backup. No service/process/shortcuts/debug listener/tuning state remains;
the direct-test uninstall.exe stub remains. No tuning, Reset/ACK or policy/ledger changes ran.
Source drift: gpu-hero.png and themes/command-gpu.png are deleted under apps/ui/src/lib/assets.
Preserved these external changes; no source references found; the other 138 manifest entries match.
This tests the existing installer, not a newly rebuilt source tree. D2.6 now has native evidence.
NEXT: D3 needs eligible hardware or a separately justified policy decision; clean-Windows and remote
CI evidence remain pending. Do not repeat completed installer/UI checks or erase safety history.

Previous (2026-09-14 01:54Z): fixed the operator's dead-end Safe Loop warning after Reset. Actual
Safe Loop is now idle with no pending incident; live PowerSweep read still reported the 3/2 block.
The UI now separates cleared recovery from automatic tuning refusal. Review safety block opens
guidance, ExportForgeLog and direct safety-history navigation in all themes. Full Reset explicitly
reports completed reset / still blocked tuning after refreshing state; saved profile Apply stays
disabled. No GPU workload, live Reset/ACK, safety-policy change or incident rewrite was performed.
17 Node tests, 15 existing browser journeys and four final J09 cases passed; screenshots reviewed.
Browser transport is simulated. An optional final native export probe was unavailable because no
service/UI process remained; record says unavailable, not pass. We did not restart the service.
Current installer 08937E759599244469D94B48E9F50BE6E87C115756232E5284E2ACB203780417 was built
at 2026-09-14T01:54:50Z; all 140 sources match, service binary unchanged, kit/ZIP refreshed. It was
not reinstalled in this continuation. Details and evidence pointers are in the latest memory.md.
Safe Loop hash 1898C808...EE30F (operator's reset state); ledger hash remains 490A5B75...98802.
D3 policy/eligible-hardware decision remains separate. Do not conflate successful Reset with
automatic tuning eligibility, or repeat previously passed installer tests without a reason.

Previous (2026-09-13 19:25Z): actual published v0.3.1 -> current build upgrade PASSED. Both installers
report 0.1.0; this is not a numeric-version upgrade. The old package's service-name bug reproduced;
no old runtime started, and 193 data files stayed identical. Current service start/Ping passed.
Evidence: target/beta/legacy-package-v0.3.1/upgrade-acceptance.json and upgrade-completion.json.
Original UI-hash assertion failure was a runner mistake: installed UI matched the extracted package,
whose Tauri bundle token is NSS versus UNK in the standalone executable. Preserve both reports.
Actual uninstall exposed six obsolete CPU resources. Only hooks.nsh changed to delete exact paths
and remove empty directories without recursion. New build and real targeted cleanup test PASSED:
legacy-cleanup-before.json / legacy-cleanup-after.json. All six removed; unrelated fixture and
installed PawnIO driver preserved. No service/UI/shortcuts remain; the direct uninstaller stub stays.
Current installer SHA-256: DFD6D122593DB92BD80033DEDADC8714E531143885BCA0470B692ADF3CCFD63C
(19:24:15Z). All 140 source entries match, service is byte-identical, software/hardware contracts
unchanged. Previous package/manifest are retained beside legacy evidence. Do not repeat passed tests.
Next: operator response about another NVIDIA GPU or a separately justified safety-policy review.
target/beta/safety-policy-review.json records the existing cross-run 3/2 block and why rehabilitation
cannot merely adjust its counter. No policy change/ACK/reset/GPU load ran. Clean OS and remote CI pending.

Previous (2026-09-13 07:57Z): all remaining desktop/service checks PASSED and cleanup completed.
Evidence: target/beta/installed-desktop-remainder/finish-session.json, post-verification.json,
ui-offline.json/png, ui-reconnected.json/png and MissingBinary-result.json. Real Stop, offline
action blocking, missing-binary refusal, exact restore/start, reconnect and uninstall passed.
No service, UI, debug listener, app binaries or shortcuts remain; safety hashes match backup.
An earlier wrapper misreported child exits; its actual Stop/Uninstall journals passed. Owned
process handles now read explicit exit 0/1 correctly and the final whole session passed. Production
sources are unchanged and all 140 manifest hashes match. Do not rerun these completed scenarios.
Continue D3 eligibility/policy review and legacy upgrade/clean-Windows/CI evidence from roadmap.md.

Previous checkpoint: installed desktop UI evidence passed in the real host, using the same frozen
package. C:\Program Files\Nidavellir Desktop Acceptance now contains the test installation.
The UI ran unelevated; NVIDIA detection, actual Tauri/pipe read responses, safety refusal,
Settings/Forge navigation and Desktop/Start Menu shortcuts passed. Screenshots and 193-file backup:
target/beta/installed-desktop-acceptance/. See desktop-summary.json and memory.md.
Windows UAC canceled the requested Stop before control.ps1 ran. Service remains Running/Automatic;
UI was closed normally and debug port 9226 is closed. No GPU workload, ACK, reset or Apply ran.
Do not claim offline/reconnect or missing-binary tests passed; they remain pending, as does cleanup.
No new conversational host permission is needed, but the Windows UAC prompt must be accepted.
Do not re-run Install or silently retry canceled elevation. Use existing phase controller after
checking reports. Previous lifecycle acceptance below remains valid for the previous test directory.

Current result: the operator authorized this PC; VM is optional. The real lifecycle PASSED at
2026-09-13T02:40:51Z: verified 192-file backup, install/Ping, running reinstall, SCM Stop,
stopped reinstall and uninstall/history retention. Unelevated IPC Ping also passed. Evidence:
target/beta/installer-host-acceptance/acceptance-report.json and post-lifecycle-verification.json.
Service/processes and UI/service binaries are absent. Safety hashes are unchanged; only normal
heartbeat/Sentinel/clean-shutdown files changed. No ACK/reset/Forge/Apply/GPU workload was requested.
Current build: 2026-09-13T02:39:30Z, installer SHA-256
7524EFB1DE40464F0356B748E1AD70042F7D7EA3775CDCCFD791466A336A301C; all 140 source hashes match.
Do not repeat this successful lifecycle. Continue the remaining D5 UI/upgrade/failure evidence
and D3 eligibility from roadmap.md. Read-only post-install preflight retains the 3/2 crash block.

Previous checkpoint before host authorization: 692 Rust / 16 Node / 16 browser tests passed. Three new Rust regressions reject
stale/malformed bugcheck attribution: August's old 0x116 must not classify a later interruption.
The actual cause of September's code-zero reboot remains unconfirmed, and its ledger is preserved.
The VM kit is in scripts/installer-acceptance.ps1 (Prepare/Inspect/Run), documented in
docs/installer-acceptance.md. Host refusal and stale-runner refusal passed; actual VM tests need access.
Session-4 packaging passed at 2026-09-13T01:51:49 UTC; log:
target/beta/build-full-release-attribution.log. The kit is target/beta/installer-acceptance.zip;
its runner and installer match the manifest. Preflight refreshed at 01:53:19 remains blocked,
and host safety hashes are unchanged. The operator was asked whether to use an existing disposable
VM or prepare one in Hyper-V. No environment answer has arrived yet. Session usage: 63%.

Previous checkpoint: shared console/SCM shutdown,
worker/Sentinel quiescence, late-cleanup refusal and real isolated process termination are covered
in software. SCM Running now requires pipe readiness; installer retries reject failed shutdown.
Packaging passed at 2026-09-12T20:19:50 UTC: target/beta/build-full-release-shutdown.log and
target/release/release-manifest.json. Read-only preflight with the rebuilt service passed its
integrity checks at 20:20:39 and still refuses this GPU. Next: isolated installer acceptance and
eligible hardware; actual SCM/GPU outcomes cannot be inferred from the software tests.
This GPU is blocked by 3 effective crashes versus limit 2; preserve its pending incident and safety
evidence. The user was asked whether another Windows/GPU test environment is available.

How to pick this up cold. Current state is the 2026-08-25 fail-closed hardening of the split contract:
Discovery v7, Frontier v28, Exact Apply v29, with the workload/API matrix still v27. Older dated
sections remain as history and are superseded where they describe one qualification version for both
frontier and Apply, exact frontier Texture residency, Clean ignoring durable negatives, or automatic
post-TDR continuation into a newly selected mode.
Deep NvAPI struct details live in `~/.claude/.../memory/gpu-forge-real-v031.md`.

## START-HERE (2026-08-25) — release built offline; do not Resume the old-build checkpoint

- Software hardening is complete. CandidateCrash must be `sync_data`-flushed and read back as the
  exact Rigid v29 event before Forge may persist `interrupted`; failure stays `needs_attention` and is
  repaired on startup without changing the raw lane or pending incident. F2 observation/condemnation
  corruption refuses live discovery, synthesis, gate, publication, Apply and Resume.
- Sentinel startup is transactional: checked Event Log snapshot/reconciliation, durable seed/floor,
  watcher-ready handshake, then and only then boot reapply. Benchmark routes F2 through the same
  proof-aware writer as normal Apply. Legacy real/memory workers require checked preflight and an
  owned BootFlag transaction before every write.
- Full Reset now means reset reusable positive learning, not negative safety memory. It waits for all
  mutating workers, removes only validated F2 positives/profile knowledge with cross-file preflight
  and rollback, and preserves pending incidents, Safe Loop blacklist, Rigid/Quarantine ledger, cone
  and Sentinel history.
- Offline gate: 674 workspace tests pass; two explicit hardware smokes remain ignored; workspace
  check, production UI build, Clippy and diff-check pass. The operator deliberately deferred all
  service/ACK/hardware activity. At handoff the service must be stopped, `boot_flag.json` and
  `gpu_applied.json` absent, and the pending `1860@900` incident unacknowledged. Release
  `target\release\nidavellir-service.exe` and Tauri sidecar
  `apps\ui\src-tauri\binaries\nidavellir-service-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` are byte-identical:
  12,515,840 bytes, SHA-256 `F90E8DF2878422F543656FAAF4551F6941E53586C77E4D3DA58F55F26DC09BCA`.
- Next-day procedure: deploy/start this exact rebuilt service, verify Ping/Safe Loop/ledger while
  stock, ACK the pending incident, expect old-build Resume to refuse, then explicitly start a new
  Standard/Persistent run under monitoring. Do not use Clean and do not delete negative evidence.

## START-HERE (2026-08-14) — rebuild, reboot, acknowledge, then run Standard under the TDR cone

- Do not mutate the GPU in the boot that observed a TDR. After deploying the rebuilt sidecar, restart
  Windows once, acknowledge the pending Forge incident, and start Standard. A crash checkpoint may
  Resume only when its run, exact service build, GPU and driver still match; a rebuilt binary therefore
  correctly starts a new run rather than importing incompatible in-flight state.
- Contract identity is **Discovery7 / Frontier28 / ExactApply29 / matrix27**. Discovery PowerRender and
  Frontier Texture accept at most one adjacent physical clock bin; exact Apply is strict. Exact Apply
  still runs finite DX11 v2 420 s → Vulkan 120/300 s → DX12 120/300 s → Endurance 300/1,200 s.
- Three homogeneous DX11 structural inconclusives at one exact pair become
  `DX11StructuralClockDrop`. It authorizes one vertical repair for that target, then closes the target
  if it repeats. It is not a physical failure, pass, quarantine or rigid event.
- The two effective v29 CandidateCrash incidents currently known on this GPU are `1920@931` and
  `1860@900`. Their 1:1 physical-bin cones overlap by taking the highest floor. A candidate at/below
  the result is censored before Safe Loop arm or GPU write; the first physical bin above it still must
  pass Frontier28. Censorship writes no pass/fail/ledger evidence.
- Clean archives/rebuilds positive learning and profiles only. It **must** still apply global Rigid,
  Quarantine and the TDR cone. Never delete or scope these negatives to the new Clean run.
- Sentinel owns TDR terminal projection: `phase=interrupted`, `last_outcome=TdrOrCrash`, no profiles;
  retain the raw lane as originally persisted. After reboot and acknowledgement, the recovery UI may
  only Resume that same compatible run and may not offer a mode change or silently call Start.
- The persistent frontier crash budget is two effective CandidateCrash events for the GPU/current
  exact contract. The existing two events are the intended evidence allowance. If a third is ever
  recorded despite the cone, subsequent candidate exploration fails closed instead of searching for
  another detector or retry loop.

## HISTORICAL (2026-08-11, superseded by Frontier28/ExactApply29) — run a new Clean Run under Discovery v7

- Discovery v7 permits one adjacent 15 MHz boost bin only in PowerRender discovery. Texture boundary
  qualification and all v27 exact-Apply lanes retain exact target residency; do not copy the discovery
  tolerance into Apply or `F2_APPLY_CLOCK_HOLD_TOL_MHZ`.
- Boundary state is GPU/run-wide across pruning, the live loop and summary. A good boundary requires
  current Discovery and Texture at the same target/anchor pair. Same-run/same-GPU qualification may
  dominate a reset-clean `ClockDrop` at the same target only at a strictly lower voltage, or at a
  harder target at the same/lower voltage. Silent error, instability, device loss/TDR and reset failure
  are never relaxed.
- A dominated drop in the active call may provide only the bounded-writer offset baseline. Continue
  directly to the next lower physical VF bin; never mark it good, revisit it or climb from it.
- Synthesis consumes the monotonic qualified projection: ascending targets select the lowest measured
  qualified anchor not below the prior anchor. Plateaus are valid; omit a target with no compatible
  measured alternative. Never invent or relabel voltage evidence.
- Margin is one physical VF bin above the boundary, not fixed `+12 mV`. An unqualified candidate may
  reach the v27 matrix up to the numeric power cap; after the complete gate, publication requires the
  worst measured Apply power to be at most 99% of that cap.
- v7 quarantines every v6 positive Discovery row. Do **not** Resume
  `f2-forge-1786398122152`; begin a new Clean Run from the rebuilt service. The integrated software
  checks are green. Hardware acceptance is still pending and no current result should be inferred
  from older runs.

## HISTORICAL (2026-08-10, superseded by Discovery v7) — Resume reconciliation plan for the inverted frontier

- Do not publish or interpret the paused preview `1755@937 … 1875@975, 1935@906` as a valid curve.
  The exported log proved that reset-clean `ClockDrop` at 968 mV had been promoted to `first_bad`
  for easier clocks even after the same run qualified harder `1920@900` and `1935@906` points.
- Core now treats only this contradicted `ClockDrop` class as non-boundary. It requires same-run,
  same-GPU current Discovery plus current Qualification at a harder clock and same/lower voltage.
  Silent errors, instability, device loss/TDR and reset failures retain their original authority.
- Service Resume supplies the same-run harder-target context, reopening 13 affected clock drops in
  `f2-forge-1786398122152`. Synthesis also fails closed on any frontier where voltage falls as clock
  rises. Same-voltage plateaus are allowed because independently measured targets may share a VF bin.
- Validation at that earlier checkpoint was core 110/110 and service 422/422. Corrected debug service revision was
  `069af31eb29fde958c15fbb1520b5b3e02f8bf31-dirty-3bdede309982`. The paused checkpoint was copied to
  `C:\ProgramData\Nidavellir\forge_state.pre-voltage-order-fix-20260810-2252.json`, migrated to that
  revision and live-loaded with `resume_available=true`. That Resume instruction is now superseded:
  discovery v7 requires a new Clean Run.

## HISTORICAL EVIDENCE (2026-08-10) — driver 610.62 exact-residency run

- UI commands no longer depend on the elevated service's restrictive default pipe descriptor.
  `NidavellirCore` uses a protected local ACL: SYSTEM/Administrators have full access, the local
  interactive user has read/write, and remote clients are rejected. This fixed the observed
  `Full reset failed: Failed to connect to Core Service: Acesso negado (0x80070005)` without
  elevating the UI. A live unelevated client reached the rebuilt service and all 420 service tests
  pass. The failed reset never reached the backend, so it did not erase learning.
- Full `matrix_v27` at `1815@887` passed DX11 420 s, Vulkan 120 s, DX12 120 s and Endurance
  300 s with 192,370 frames, 22,434 checks, 100% target residency, fixed 887 mV and no current-boot
  driver event. Cleanup returned stock; Safe Loop stayed idle with no recovery latch.
- Raw `1800@875` was workload-stable for 420 s but physically ran at 1785 MHz. It failed closed as
  `Inconclusive/target_residency_low`; Vulkan, DX12 and Endurance were not needlessly run. Separate
  60-second probes at 887 mV held 1800 and 1815 MHz exactly.
- That checkpoint retained a fixed 12 mV post-frontier margin; discovery v7 supersedes it with exactly
  one physical-bin margin. Its exact-residency evidence remains historical support for v27. Do not
  reinterpret the 595.97 safe label as an exact-delivery guarantee on 610.62 or relax v27 residency.
- The only code adjustment from this campaign is observability: matrix progress advances inside a
  lane and the stock preflight exposes its active API. Qualification behavior is unchanged.
- Evidence: `C:\ProgramData\Nidavellir\detector-lab-1786388939075.jsonl` (raw boundary) and
  `C:\ProgramData\Nidavellir\detector-lab-1786389954809.jsonl` (post-margin matrix).

## HISTORICAL CONTRACT (2026-08-04) — v27 is finite, DX11-first and containment-complete

- The production one-click Forge keeps synthetic qualification. An exact candidate now requires
  current, reset-clean, same-run passes for native DX11 v2, Vulkan Texture Hop, the same Texture Hop
  through explicit DX12, and Endurance. Qualification contract is 27; all older positives fail
  closed for Apply.
- Vulkan/DX12 are no longer chosen implicitly by wgpu. Each backend captures its own stock goldens
  and runs the same recipe/duration. Stock preflight runs all three APIs before any candidate write.
- DX11 v2 is a 1536² headless texture/depth/ROP + pixel-ALU + compute/UAV workload. It queues 16
  frames between synchronization points and requires both framebuffer and compute checksums; the old
  per-frame Flush/wait bottleneck is gone.
- Exact execution order is DX11 v2 resident 420 s → Vulkan → DX12 → Endurance. Standard then uses
  120 s per wgpu API + 300 s Endurance (16 min total); Long uses 300 s + 1,200 s (37 min). ETA and
  execution share the same finite ladder.
- Any physical failure rejects the pair. Missing backend/golden/telemetry/checksum or low residency
  is `Inconclusive` and blocks publication without manufacturing silicon condemnation.
- Hardware calibration: trusted `1800@875` passed 420.248 s. Rigid `1860@868` previously triggered
  nvlddmkm-153 around 347 s, practically matching Overwatch, but later passed 420.230 s and 600.247 s.
  DX11 is therefore the strongest reproducer found, not a deterministic one-pass discriminator.
- Stop rule: do not extend dwell or create v28/shader variants to chase a guaranteed rejection. Keep
  the 12 mV margin, physical-bin snap and finite exact gate; report the residual false-negative risk.
- TDR containment: Sentinel requests cooperative cancellation from active Forge/Detector Lab and
  preserves attribution. `SafeLoopStatus.gpu_reboot_required` makes Forge show only `Restart Windows`
  and hides same-boot continuation/reset actions. The failed point and useful learning are retained.
- Known deliberate limitation: all lanes are offscreen for API comparability; swapchain/Present and
  a killable worker-process boundary are not implemented in this patch.

## HISTORICAL (2026-08-04, superseded by v27 above) — v26 three-API exact-Apply gate

The v26 matrix established backend equivalence and fail-closed evidence, but used Vulkan first and
120/300 s for DX11. Its implementation and pre-calibration stop rule are retained in history below.

## HISTORICAL (2026-08-04, superseded by v26 above) — exact Overwatch failure isolated the native DX11 qualification gap

- The manual labels were MSI Afterburner flat-curve settings, not proof of fixed physical pairs.
  `1815@875` and `1800@869` are therefore indeterminate rather than exact known-bad anchors.
- The live locked campaign completed 13/13 stable 60-second candidates across `1800@875`,
  `1815@875`, resolved `1800@868`, one-bin-corrected `1830@875` and `1815@868`, using
  `control_v25`/`dense_v14`. No current-boot TDR or Safe Loop contamination occurred.
- Backend-only `curve_v25` removes only the voltage lock to inspect the dynamic VF envelope. A
  60-second `1815@875` control stayed at 1815/875. The strongest historical bad control,
  `1860@868`, then passed every workload phase for 300 seconds: p5/p95 1845/1860 MHz, voltage
  868..1037 mV, 89.01% target residency, 17,971 frames and 2,372 checksums. This is a workload false
  negative plus an anchor escape, not validation of the setting.
- Classification now journals workload outcome separately from application fidelity. Curve voltage
  escape is metadata, not `Inconclusive`; low/missing telemetry stays inconclusive. Curve diagnostics
  are never publishable and always reset to stock.
- Candidate execution journals recipe/segment start before GPU work. Startup recovery treats
  `detector_lab` as non-learning, returns stock and avoids blacklist/crash-streak/Safe Mode learning.
- The subsequent supervised Overwatch 2 trace confirmed `1860@868` as a physical positive. Across
  32,525 samples, clock and voltage were exactly 1860/868 with no stretch or voltage escape. The
  final 83.8 s high-load block ended in nvlddmkm-153; eight 153s, nvlddmkm-14 and bugcheck 0x116
  followed. WER named nvlddmkm.sys and the game logged its DX11 Lost Device callback.
- The game used DX11 at 2544x1353, 600-FPS cap and Reflex, with graphics/compute/copy queues. The
  primary qualifier is Vulkan/wgpu. The legacy DX11 probe is a serialized 768x768 offscreen ALU
  shader with per-frame Flush/wait and no Present, texture/depth, compute/copy overlap or frame queue;
  it drew only 99-133 W historically and was retired after never rejecting.
- Nine TextureRop canaries returned stable; the last ended 11.5 s before the TDR. The monitor saw the
  first event in about 1.06 s, but no stock reset completed before the TDR cascade. Post-reboot GPU
  state is physically stock and Safe Loop stayed idle/non-learning; `boot_flag.json` remains armed
  in `game_trace_curve_diagnostic`, and the service is stopped. Reconcile before another GPU write.
- This was the pre-v26 stop plan: the only allowed challenger was native DX11 v2 with real
  Present/frames-in-flight and mixed graphics/texture/depth/compute/copy work, isolated in a worker
  process. Fixed matrix: stock 2x120 s, safe `1800@875` curve 2x120 s, positive `1860@868` curve
  1x120 s. If it misses, end synthetic qualification R&D and adopt conservative in-game probation.
  Full evidence and stop rules: `docs/f2-disqualification-audit-2026-08-04.md`.

## START-HERE (2026-07-23) — v25 enforces the selected voltage and exact-clock evidence

- Game Trace at the requested `1815@875` exposed that the former point was only an elastic clock
  envelope: about 92% of high-utilization samples were 1800 MHz, only about 63 s accumulated at
  `1815@875`, and live voltage could exceed 875 mV. The previous clean 10-minute synthetic result
  therefore did not prove the labeled point.
- Active F2 now writes the anchored curve, applies a max-only clock ceiling and sets/read-backs an
  exact NVAPI voltage lock at the resolved physical bin. Clock can still downclock; voltage cannot
  rise above the selected bin. Profile Apply and Manual Point use the same writer.
- Discovery contract is 6: p5 below the exact target is ClockDrop, even by one boost bin.
  Qualification contract is 25: only samples at the exact target count toward the existing 35%
  residency requirement, and missing/insufficient/above-bin voltage evidence is Inconclusive.
  Pre-v6/v25 positives cannot seed/publish under the new semantics.
- Detector Lab canonical key/UI is `control_v25`; v24/v23 keys are compatibility aliases. Candidate
  runs use `single_qualifier_dwell_with_cancel`, record clock/voltage/power/coverage in the journal,
  and return stock with `inconclusive` when point authority is not proven.
- Reset paths and boot reapply release stale clock and voltage locks before continuing. Fixed
  voltage is intentionally more TDR-prone than the old elastic rail; Safe Loop remains the recovery
  boundary. The clock is deliberately not min=max pinned.
- First hardware Apply exposed a ClockBoostLock slot bug: the API returned success for a write to
  entry `0` but retained no manual lock. Stock readback exposes entries `0..6`; the corrected writer
  derives entry `6` as the highest writable voltage slot, clears all entries in a dedicated write,
  then writes only entry `6`. Readback polls for up to one second before requiring the exact sole
  entry/voltage. Unlock clears all entries too. A new failure reports the full readback reason
  instead of the former opaque “could not be verified”.
- The next Apply exposed a driver ordering constraint: `GetClockBoostLock` returned
  `ArgumentExceedMaxSize` only after the VF curve and NVML ceiling were active. Both Forge candidates
  and Manual/Profile Apply now lock and verify voltage in the stock control state before writing the
  anchored curve and max-clock ceiling. Service 415/0, gpu-nvapi 40/0, service check and
  `git diff --check` pass; the debug backend was rebuilt/restarted clean and hardware Apply retry is
  pending.
- Software gates passed: workspace tests 583/0 (1 hardware smoke ignored), `cargo check
  --workspace`, UI production build, clippy with baseline warnings only and `git diff --check`.
  No GPU workload was executed while implementing v25.
- Hardware acceptance after a clean reboot: first run the trusted `1800@875` control and verify
  journal voltage max `<=875`, exact-clock residency and a clean reset; only then compare
  `1815@875`. Do not interpret a low-residency Inconclusive as stability or instability.

## START-HERE (2026-07-23) — v24 keeps dual-queue stress and removes device-lifetime churn

- Latest 10-minute Lab attempt at trusted `1800@875` did not test that point. Its full v23 stock
  control failed during Field Concurrency before the journal ever recorded `point_reapplied`.
  A previous `1815@875` attempt also failed at stock after entering the same phase.
- The old secondary worker repeatedly constructed and dropped a complete `GpuCtx`. The 10-minute
  mirror therefore became a driver-resource churn test and could reset an otherwise-stock GPU.
- Texture Hop v13-r3 creates one secondary TextureRop context after the primary Texture Stack begins,
  keeps it resident for the whole phase and uses cooperative cancellation. The independent queue and
  checksum oracle remain; only repeated device lifetime transitions are gone.
- A secondary initialization failure, worker panic or fewer than two secondary checksum windows
  produces an internal `inconclusive_reason`, removes Field Concurrency from coverage and aborts the
  stock/Lab control as an environment error. Candidate failure/blacklist paths cannot consume it.
- Qualification contract is 24. Current fingerprints are
  `f2q-texhop-v13-r3/v13-persistent-field-concurrency` and
  `f2q-texhop-v13-r3/endurance-persistent-field-concurrency`; all v23 positives are quarantined.
  Detector Lab and UI use `control_v24`, with `control_v23` accepted backend-only as a compatibility
  alias.
- Software gates passed: gpu-stress 20/0 (1 hardware smoke ignored), core 106/0, service 415/0,
  `cargo check --workspace`, UI production build and clippy with the existing warnings only.
  Repository-wide rustfmt check remains noisy from the pre-existing formatting baseline.
- Do not run more hardware load in the TDR-dirty boot. After reboot, acceptance starts with the full
  v24 stock mirror. Only after repeated stock passes should the same trusted point and a deliberately
  marginal point be compared.

## START-HERE (2026-07-22) — quarantine v23 after TDR; mirror the full stock sequence

- Hardware bake-off exposed three `nvlddmkm-153` resets at the same v23 boundary
  (`Field Concurrency → TextureRop`): one at `1845@856` and two at the operator-proven
  `1800@875`, while dense v14 passed between the latter two. The two post-TDR v23 results are not
  valid candidate evidence; they can be a dirty driver/context state that the former stock preflight
  did not reproduce.
- A TDR now latches `reboot_required` for the current Windows boot from the durable Event Log. Service
  restart cannot clear it. Forge, resume, profile/manual Apply and Detector Lab are refused until a
  newer Windows boot; Reset and read-only diagnostics remain available. This latch writes no
  blacklist or condemnation.
- v23 no longer treats a standalone 15 s Field Concurrency preflight as an equivalent control.
  Production runs one complete 60 s v23 Texture Hop at stock before the first candidate. Detector Lab
  mirrors the selected v23 duration at stock and journals every stock segment before applying the
  candidate. A stock failure is environmental/recipe evidence, never candidate evidence.
- Detector Lab preserves the panic payload and correlates a new `nvlddmkm-153` with its session. The
  terminal state is `tdr` / `reboot_required`, including the active phase and event timestamp, rather
  than the generic `environment_error`. Candidate and stock segment records carry an explicit scope.
- Candidate workload, contract v23 fingerprints and non-publishable Lab boundary are unchanged.
  Software validation is required; hardware acceptance begins only after reboot and must start with
  the automatic full-stock control. Do not run the old v23 binary again on an undervolted point.

## START-HERE (2026-07-22) — run the v14 bake-off from Advanced Diagnostics

- Detector Lab is available under Manual Point. Apply a temporary point first, then compare
  `v23 control` and `v14 dense` for the same selected duration (15–600 s). The worker briefly returns
  stock for golden capture, reapplies the exact resolved point under Safe Loop and shows live
  stage/phase/progress. Do not start a risky point unattended.
- `dense_v14` is a static experimental sequence: Power opening, then short HeavySpike,
  FrameCadence, MixedGame and BoostEdge perturbations, each followed by a dense TextureRop oracle;
  TextureRop owns at least 60% of the requested GPU dwell. `control_v23` runs the current v23 Texture
  Hop so the same hardware point has a direct baseline.
- Evidence boundary is strict: neither result touches `f2_observations.jsonl`, Apply qualification,
  profiles, blacklist or condemnation. The only artifact is
  `%ProgramData%\Nidavellir\detector-lab-<epoch>.jsonl`, synchronously recording each upcoming segment.
  Qualification contract v23 is unchanged.
- Stable leaves the temporary point active for the other recipe or Game Trace. SilentError,
  Unstable, Crash, cooperative Stop, panic or environment failure returns stock and disarms Safe
  Loop. A hard reset during a segment remains attributable through the armed boot flag and the last
  flushed journal line.
- Software gates passed: core/gpu-stress/service tests and UI production build. No hardware run was
  performed. Next action: supervised paired runs at the same point and duration, starting with v23
  control, then v14 dense; preserve both journals for comparison.

## START-HERE (2026-07-22) — publish only qualified frontier points; measure cap coverage numerically

- Clean run `f2-forge-1784759763148` finished its search in about 25.7 minutes without a hardware
  incident but published no profiles. Discovery had valid qualified points at `1860@937`, `1815@937`,
  `1725@925` and `1695@900`; later discovery-only passes at lower voltage displaced them in the one
  shared frontier, so exact Apply tried unqualified pairs and reconciliation refused publication.
  Separately, eight pairs produced 24 `PowerTelemetryInconclusive` rows in the 98–99% cap band, and
  short BoostEdge phases let a few sticky `SW_POWER_CAP` samples contradict numeric power.
- Contract v23 separates the deepest physical discovery frontier from the deepest publishable
  frontier. Exact Apply/profile synthesis consume only a pair with every required current-contract
  qualification pass; a deeper inconclusive point stays available for boundary learning but cannot
  erase the shallower qualified result.
- Texture/Endurance qualification now uses BoostEdge numeric p95 against the actual board limit when
  available. At least 20 samples are required; p95 >=99% is power-bound, while the raw cap flag is
  diagnostic/fallback only. Texture Hop v13-r2 assigns 4% of the unchanged dwell to BoostEdge (about
  1.2 s in the 30 s Standard frontier pass). Fingerprints are
  `f2q-texhop-v13-r2/v13-field-concurrency` and
  `f2q-texhop-v13-r2/endurance-field-concurrency`.
- Discovery cap classification now has real hysteresis: >=99% NearCap, <=98% OffCap, and the middle
  band inherits the previous state. With no previous state it starts conservatively NearCap. There is
  no ambiguity blacklist and no looser stability threshold.
- Software validation passed: `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace` (576 passed,
  1 hardware smoke ignored), targeted frontier/coverage/hysteresis/workload regressions and the UI
  production build. Clippy completes with the existing repository warnings only. Hardware acceptance
  remains one Clean/Standard run: qualified shallower
  points must survive into exact Apply instead of being replaced by deeper inconclusive discovery;
  ordinary off-cap BoostEdge telemetry must not consume three retries.

## START-HERE (2026-07-20) — inconclusive handling hardened after the v13 re-hammer TDR

- Clean run `f2-forge-1784423357172` (contract v22 / Texture Hop v13) TDR'd at `1890@925` on the 6th
  texture dwell of that pair, after `1905@925` was skipped with 3 Inconclusive. The persisted
  `f2_observations.jsonl` shows the 6 `QualificationInconclusive` rows were `boost_edge_power_bound`
  (4×) + `phase_contrast_low` (2×) — deterministic power-cap interference (p99 192–195 W vs 200 W cap),
  not silicon. The engine then re-hammered the unproven bin: it seeded the next clock from the
  inconclusive point and the warm-start fallback re-descended to the exact same pair and re-ran the
  heaviest qualifier until the driver watchdog fired. The real TDR was blacklisted correctly.
- Fixed in the engine only (`gpu_undervolt.rs` + `gpu_power_sweep.rs`); no workload/contract/threshold
  change, no per-GPU constant, no version bump. Inconclusive is now treated as *unproven*, never as
  good-frontier memory or a repeat target, and is still never blacklisted (blacklisting ambiguity would
  over-condemn every top clock near the cap): (1) reason-aware retry — the two cap-interference reasons
  no longer burn the retry budget and the reason is logged; (2) an anchor left qualification-Inconclusive
  this run is excluded from the `last_good_mv` seed; (3) the warm-start fallback is suppressed on an
  inconclusive stop, plus a guard that skips re-qualifying a pair already inconclusive this run.
- Validation: `cargo check --workspace`, service tests 411/0 (3 new pure-helper regression tests),
  clippy unchanged from baseline. NO hardware/Forge/Apply run.
- **Next physical action:** acknowledge the reconciled TDR incident and run manual Reset (the run log
  requires it), then a Clean/Standard run. Acceptance: cap-bound bins print their reason and run ONE
  texture dwell (no 30→45→45 s escalation); a skipped clock seeds the next from the last clean point;
  NO second planning round or texture re-run on the same pair after an inconclusive skip. Systemic
  watch: if 1905/1890/1875 all report `boost_edge_power_bound` on every off-cap bin, top clocks may be
  unqualifiable under v22's 200 W cap — that is a workload/threshold discussion, not silicon; do not
  weaken the gate to force a pass. Texture Hop v13 itself is unchanged and still permits real TDR.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18h) — Texture Hop v13 learns the missing field-concurrency dimension

- Trace `game-trace-1784411518295.jsonl` at Brokkr's `1800@831` held 1800 MHz and 97–100% GPU
  utilization around 145–152 W before a 131→89→56 W power collapse, two nvlddmkm-153 events and a
  `0x133` reboot. Existing v12 Texture Stack/Endurance p95 power was already 150.5/151.9 W, so higher
  synthetic power was rejected as the wrong lever. The trace exposed one missing topology: the game
  context overlapped the independently created live-Sentinel canary context/queue.
- Contract v22 / Texture Hop v13 keeps the established primary Texture Stack resident and repeatedly
  creates a fresh secondary `GpuCtx` for the same 700 ms TextureRop self-check used in the field.
  Irregular compressed gaps yield several context-creation/scheduling overlaps within Standard's
  short dwell. Primary stock-golden mismatch, secondary self-reference divergence, DeviceLost or TDR
  rejects the point; neither context has a pre-hang wall-time abort.
- Golden capture now ends with a 15 s stock Field Concurrency preflight before any candidate write.
  A driver/backend that cannot support the dual-device path aborts Forge at stock and creates no bad
  candidate evidence. Current fingerprints are `f2q-texhop-v13-r1/v13-field-concurrency` and
  `f2q-texhop-v13-r1/endurance-field-concurrency`; all pre-v22 positives are quarantined.
- Do NOT manually blacklist `1800@831` from this experiment. It was a deliberately selected
  calibration point. The implementation did not mutate ProgramData or import the trace. Acceptance:
  run Clean/Standard and require `field-concurrency` to reject the neighborhood organically; if it
  still passes, use Game Trace v3's canary active/sequence markers for the next refinement.
- Future non-calibration field failures are safer: applied profiles persist `applied_at`; startup
  only attributes a later OC-class WER bugcheck to that session. The Event Log watcher polls every
  second and persists its cursor only after recovery returns, so a reset-time wedge remains pending
  for next boot. Legacy profiles remain unattributable, preventing retroactive learning here.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18g) — Texture Hop v12 permits real failure; Standard completes its plan

- Contract v21 turns the legacy CompositeGameLoad workload into a heterogeneous Texture Stack.
  TextureRop on the small cache-resident source, TextureStream on the large VRAM-resident source,
  power render and near-full-VRAM scattered gather execute in one submit. The final render lane
  rotates across TextureRop/TextureStream/PowerRender and is checked against the matching stock golden.
- The active Texture Hop no longer schedules standalone banded TextureStream, whose pre-hang timer
  ended a phase before the driver watchdog. Texture Stack has no wall-time abort; wrong output,
  DeviceLost or Windows TDR rejects the exact point. Keep the per-frame queue fence: it models a game
  present boundary and prevents an unrelated driver-queue flood. Safe Loop recovery remains mandatory.
- Standard's individual proof remains 30 s frontier + 2 min Texture Hop + 5 min Endurance per unique
  exact Apply pair, but the global 59-minute watchdog and all budget-exhaustion terminal copy are gone.
  Standard now finishes its hardware-derived plan unless Stop or a real failure interrupts it. Long
  remains the explicit exhaustive 60 s + 5 min + 20 min mode.
- Next physical gate: run Clean/Standard. If a point that is known to fail in actual gameplay is still
  accepted, apply that exact point in Advanced Diagnostics and capture `game-trace-v2` through the
  reproducing match. Compare the TDR/sampler-gap/clock-power signature before changing the workload.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18f) — Texture Hop v11 combines the proven oracle with the strongest co-load

- Contract v20 promotes the strongest efficient fixed plan: golden-checked TextureRop first, a short
  idle-to-CompositeGameLoad slam, then TextureRop again. CompositeGameLoad combines heavy render,
  texture and a near-full VRAM-resident gather in one submit; it appears once so its large pool setup
  is not paid twice. About 71% of the dwell belongs to this detector pair.
- Historical observations support the split: organic v17/v18 silent-error rejections named
  `texture-rop`, while the current suite already identifies CompositeGameLoad as its highest combined
  real-game-like draw. TextureStream remains severity-last because it is more TDR-prone.
- Texture Hop's fingerprint is now `f2q-texhop-v11-r1/v11-texture`; all pre-v20 positive evidence is
  quarantined by the contract bump. Durations, Standard's one-hour bound and blacklist semantics did
  not change. Hardware acceptance still requires a clean run against the bad and good local controls.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18e) — manual point replaces the retired Texture Lab

- Advanced Diagnostics now exposes Manual point instead of Texture Lab. Enter any hardware-local
  clock and VF-bin request; the backend resolves only to the nearest physical bin within 8 mV and
  applies the same bounded anchored curve used by F2 profiles, without a hard voltage lock.
- The point is temporary and never becomes Forge evidence or a persisted profile. Applying clears a
  previously saved GPU profile, holds the Safe Loop intent throughout the real workload and blocks
  other GPU writers. Return to stock explicitly after the test; graceful service shutdown also resets.
- Current experiment: apply the known-bad `1800@869` request, open Game Trace, play the real Overwatch
  scenario and stop Game Trace after leaving the match. Texture Lab IPC/UI and its unproven synthetic
  experimental helpers were removed; fixed Forge qualification was v19 at that checkpoint.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18d) — manual Overwatch oracle with Game Trace v2

- Exact `1800@868` survived every fixed synthetic method tried, including a 30 s Heaven + internal
  checksum co-load at 172.5 W p99. Automated Overwatch only exercised its menu (~55 W), so it was
  not representative gameplay evidence. The next experiment is operator-played Overwatch at the
  known-bad `1800@869` request with Game Trace enabled.
- Game Trace now writes contract `game-trace-v2`: its header snapshots the complete live VF curve,
  initial voltage and pre-run `nvlddmkm` TDR event; each row includes wall time, actual sampling gap,
  NVML validity and distinguishes attempted/successful voltage reads. It flushes every 50 rows.
- A clean stop appends aggregate clock/power/voltage/gap/missing-sample statistics and compares the
  latest TDR event with the baseline. The trace remains read-only. If a reboot interrupts the
  summary, the flushed pre-failure rows plus Sentinel startup reconciliation remain the evidence.
- Before playing: apply `1800@869`, start Game Trace, verify the live mV/clock values respond, then
  play the workload that has reproduced the failure. Stop Game Trace only after leaving the match.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18c) — calibrate Texture Hop numerically

- Texture Lab now exposes real runtime controls for Texture Hop instead of requiring another
  workload-version bump: dependent shader rounds (8–256), frames per load-release hop (1–64) and
  the true idle transition gap (0–500 ms). Four UI presets are only shortcuts over the same sliders.
- Every configuration captures a matching stock golden before the exact point is applied and the
  three values are retained in current status/history. Forge itself remains fixed at contract v19;
  experimental values cannot leak into Standard/Long.
- Use 1800@869 first. Change one axis at a time: rounds tests sustained TMU/ROP computation,
  frames-per-hop tests transition frequency, and gap tests transition depth. Repeat the winning
  configuration at 1815@875. A reset-clean rejection remains diagnostic-only; a real device loss
  still follows normal Safe Loop recovery.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18b) — use the temporary Texture Lab, not another full Forge

- The most recent run was interrupted correctly: it reported persistent learning and repeatedly
  stopped on BlacklistedBoundary, so it was not evidence of organic v19 discovery. Clean Run now
  remains visible in all primary mode selectors instead of appearing only after Full Reset.
- Advanced Diagnostics → Texture Lab owns the next physical experiment. Start with the editable
  presets 1800@869 and 1815@875, select one method, and run 10–55 seconds. The UI shows the real
  physical VF bin chosen for a non-physical request; the backend never descends clock or voltage.
- Compare Texture Hop v10, Texture transitions, Stream pressure and Endurance front one at a time.
  Trial history is memory-only and clears on service restart. Reset-clean rejection is deliberately
  not persisted as blacklist/condemnation/Forge evidence; device loss still arms normal recovery.
- **Acceptance:** a method must reject both known-bad points repeatably in under one minute. After
  that, fold the winner into the Forge qualification contract, retire the temporary experiment and
  only then spend time on a new full Clean Run.

## START-HERE (2026-07-18) — validate Texture Hop v10 against the 1800 MHz hardware oracle

- Qualification contract v19 introduces Texture Hop v10. The TextureRop shader now performs 64
  dependent rounds with four texture samples each, and the plan drives it immediately through
  irregular 2/3/5/7-frame bursts and gaps around composite/power transitions. The semantic
  fingerprint is `f2q-texhop-v10-r1`; pre-v19 positive evidence cannot unlock Apply.
- Standard is the default bounded proof: 30 s per frontier candidate, then 2 min Texture Hop + 5 min
  Endurance per publishable exact pair. A 59-minute active-work watchdog leaves one minute for final
  reset/checkpoint. Budget exhaustion preserves completed learning, blocks incomplete profiles and
  cannot resume as Standard. Long is the only explicitly selected mode allowed beyond one hour and
  retains 60 s + 5 min + 20 min.
- Fast is removed from the product. The legacy `StartPowerSweepFast` IPC request maps to Standard only
  for mixed-version compatibility. The main Command Deck and alternate themes expose Clean,
  Standard and Long; Clean always remains available and follows the Standard budget.
- **Next physical action:** perform Full Reset and run Clean/Standard. This build is acceptable only
  if it rejects the known-bad `1800 MHz @ 869 mV` neighborhood, climbs toward the repeatedly trusted
  `1800 MHz @ 875 mV` boundary and finishes or fails closed in at most one hour. Do not encode those
  values as universal tuning data: they are the regression oracle for this GPU.

## START-HERE (2026-07-17) — next run is auto-clean; validate first-run convergence

- `ResetGpuTuningFull` still preserves the append-only hardware condemnation ledger, but the UI now
  automatically selects a one-shot Clean Run after a successful reset. Starting Forge next uses
  `StartPowerSweepClean`, so all pre-run condemnations are ignored for search/selection while new
  failures remain durable and steer this same run; the selector returns to Standard after completion.
- Exact Apply runs Texture v9 first and stops before the 20-minute Endurance when Texture p99/peak
  already exceeds the 94%-of-cap publication ceiling. This is an energy-envelope exclusion only:
  no blacklist/ledger write and no vertical repair. Any pair still eligible must finish Endurance.
- Profile scoring/publication use the worst p99 across the complete Texture + Endurance gate.
  `stock_power_p99_w` comes from the converged stock preheat and drives the UI's per-hardware
  efficiency-vs-stock metric. Progress UI no longer shows candidate/raw profile telemetry; each
  separate profile disclosure expands to target MHz/mV, maximum power and concise efficiencies.
- **Next physical action:** perform Full Reset, confirm the mode shows Clean Run, then start Forge.
  This is the first valid test of whether v18 converges to the promising values without prior runs or
  Game Trace. Do not change v18 weights until that run proves a missed real instability or excessive
  Sentinel correction; compile tests prove orchestration, not silicon stability.

## START-HERE (2026-07-16d) — items 1/2 implemented: complete vertical closure + v18 gate

- Exact-Apply repair has no arbitrary attempt budget. A physically classified reset-clean failure
  excludes the exact bin and closes every viable higher real bin at the same clock until a physical,
  profile or publication-power boundary is proven. The condemnation view reloads before every
  decision; inconclusive/coverage/orchestration outcomes stop fail-closed without blacklist or
  inferred voltage repair. Only an actual exact-Apply `SilentError` is persisted as that quarantine
  kind; `Unstable`/`ClockDrop` may steer the current run but are not mislabeled in the durable ledger.
- The 94%-of-board-cap publication ceiling remains unchanged. Profile ceilings add electrical
  differentiation: Godforge may use the full physical domain under that common ceiling; Brokkr's
  remains at least one real voltage bin below Godforge; Deep Calm remains one bin below the lowest
  stronger profile. When Godforge exhausts a clock, it fast-drops one real clock while carrying the
  exhausted voltage, then requires fresh p99 calibration and the complete gate.
- Qualification contract v18 replaces the lobby-first Texture sequence with Texture v9,
  `TextureRop` immediately after the opening and again before later coverage. Endurance remains one
  continuous 20-minute proof but front-loads TextureRop, composite game load and cap-slam rejection.
  DX11 and standalone TransitionShock are no longer mandatory/current-run stages; their legacy
  evidence and code paths remain readable. Exact Apply is now 5 min Texture v9 + 20 min Endurance =
  25 min per unique pair, with earlier rejection possible inside either dwell.
- **Next physical action:** use a new Clean Run on this build. Verify same-clock climbs, Godforge
  fast-drop, profile voltage hierarchy, v18 workload labels and 25-minute passing-pair ladder. The
  94% off-cap ceiling and all TDR/Safe Loop/reset protections remain active.

## START-HERE (2026-07-16c) — resumable manual pause + operator-facing Forge UX

- `StopPowerSweep` is now a cooperative manual pause: UI first shows `stopping`; the checkpoint is
  marked `paused` only after completed evidence is durable and stock reset is confirmed. Resume is
  the explicit additive `ResumePowerSweep` method. A normal Start is always a new run, and a
  TDR/panic/Sentinel/Reset interruption is never promoted to a resumable manual pause.
- Resume fails closed unless program version/build revision, GPU identity/adapter and driver
  name/details match exactly. It retains the same run ID and reuses only reset-clean evidence from
  that same run; a cancelled/incomplete candidate is retried while completed bins are skipped.
  Elapsed time stays cumulative across sessions.
- Forge progress now publishes structured current/next task IDs and durations. The three home
  themes render current work, live elapsed/countdown, next work, total elapsed and finish estimate;
  these timers keep ticking locally between long backend dwell callbacks.
- Sentinel shows both the effective durable condemnation ledger and operational Safe Loop blacklist.
  The live log has bilingual red/white/green presentation tones only; safety logic never parses them.
- Main telemetry now shows VRAM clock with capacity/usage, NVAPI core mV and fan duty from all
  NVML-exposed fans (`nvidia-smi` fallback). Missing fan/voltage remains `None`; real `0%` is shown.
  Responsive grids/wrapping and minimum 40 px profile actions cover narrow-window layouts.
- **Superseded audit:** the item-1/2 deficiencies identified here are implemented by the newer
  2026-07-16d section above. Keep this paragraph only as the rationale for contract v18.

## START-HERE (2026-07-16b) — Forge learning modes; NEXT VALIDATION MUST USE CLEAN RUN

- **Two learning modes** (`ForgeLearning` in `gpu_power_sweep.rs`): `Persistent` (production, the
  P0 ledger/floor behavior below) and `CleanRun` (experimental) via the additive IPC
  `StartPowerSweepClean` / UI Forge mode "Clean run · Experimental".
- **Clean run = organic search**: at start it archives `f2_observations.jsonl` + `forge_state.json`
  into `forge-archive/<run_id>/`, snapshots `safe_loop.json` and strips its GPU V/F blacklist
  regions (Safe Mode, crash counters, incidents, non-GPU entries preserved), carries over no
  run-sequence/points/profiles, and reads the condemnation ledger RUN-SCOPED. Ledger WRITES stay
  global (production truth never lost); the run's own failures still block and steer vertical
  repair. At the end the observations are copied into the archive; the next clean run is organic
  again. Sentinel/startup recovery/TDR protections unchanged.
- **Guaranteed absent in a clean run**: "dwells redundantes pulados", "fronteira prevista … por
  fronteira v4 anterior", "retomando fronteira já delimitada", and any `BlacklistedBoundary` from
  pre-run evidence (during-run failures may still produce one — intended).
- **Validation-run checklist (CLEAN RUN, mandatory)**: (1) start via the "Clean run" mode and
  confirm the "CLEAN RUN experimental" log lines + archive folder; (2) descent shows NO reuse/
  prediction messages; (3) a gate failure climbs the SAME clock (+1/+2 bins) instead of dropping
  it; (4) repairs respect the 188 W publication ceiling; (5) failures of THIS run refuse re-descent
  below them (`BlacklistedBoundary` with current run_id only); (6) global
  `condemnation_ledger.jsonl` gained the run's quarantines/crashes afterwards.

## 2026-07-16 — P0 condemnation ledger + P1 vertical Apply repair (validation run pending)

- **New durable store**: `%ProgramData%\Nidavellir\condemnation_ledger.jsonl` — append-only memory
  of hard failures (`crates/core/src/condemnation.rs`). NO reset path may touch it
  (`clear_all_learning` documents the invariant); wire format pinned by a unit test. Seeded from
  run-log history on 2026-07-16 (2 rigid + 10 quarantine pairs).
- **Refusal is now the UNION** of the safe-loop field floor and the ledger: confirmed preflights
  (`run_confirmed_f2_apply_qualification` / `_power_calibration` / `_clock_discovery`), the descent
  BlacklistedBoundary check, CLI probes, `load_forge_state` profile restore and the IPC Apply guard.
  Rigid refuses at-or-below its floor; Quarantine refuses strictly-below and demands TWO full-gate
  passes to publish the exact pair (single pass under a STRONGER contract also re-proves).
- **Vertical repair in the exact-Apply loop** (`gpu_power_sweep.rs`): a gate failure quarantines the
  bin in the ledger, excludes it + regime dependents, then inserts a same-clock candidate +1 bin
  (SilentError) / +2 bins (TDR/device-lost), skipping condemned bins, under the PUBLICATION ceiling
  (94% of cap) with the worst honest power measurement (PowerRender calibration fills unmeasured
  bins). Budget 2 repairs/clock/run. Dominance pre-gate: only gate-APPROVED points skip a
  candidate's ladder. Pure helpers + tests: `f2_plan_vertical_repair`, `f2_repair_bin_above`,
  `repair_step_bins`, `measured_power_at_pair`, `f2_approved_dominator`.
- **Next run validates** (no workload/contract changes were made): condemnations survive; descent
  stops above ledger floors; a gate failure climbs the same clock instead of dropping it; repairs
  respect 188 W (94% × 200 W); no clock is discarded while a viable bin remains. Expected on this
  rig: 1905 exhausts almost immediately by power (906 already ≈189 W), Godforge converges around
  1890@906+/1875@887+ instead of sinking toward 1740.
- **Deferred**: Godforge fast-drop (needs per-profile selection overrides — Godforge's lowest-power
  tie-break defeats a lifted same-clock candidate); P2 = Texture v9 (texture-rop-dominated),
  Endurance front-load, DX11/TransitionShock removal, contract v18.

## 2026-07-15 — restart/accounting P0 implemented; field failures are operator-owned

- Installed-service and console startup now run the same TDR sentinel and interrupted-Forge
  reconciliation. A persisted running checkpoint becomes a durable Forge incident before startup
  recovery can consume its boot flag. An exact armed candidate is blacklisted; without an exact
  candidate the incident remains explicitly unattributed.
- Forge checkpoints now persist `run_id`, ordered `run_sequence`, active clock/voltage and progress
  before the first candidate and after every progress callback. A reconciled incident enters
  `needs_attention`; Start, Apply and boot reapply remain at stock until the operator explicitly
  acknowledges it. The UI no longer performs Reset+Start automatically.
- The ordinary recovery reset preserves the interrupted checkpoint, run sequence, blacklist and
  observations. Only `ResetGpuTuningFull` forgets them. Export filters observations to the current
  run sequence, writes a scoped companion JSONL and includes durable runtime/operator incidents.
- Forged cards expose **Mark unstable**. This resolves the currently forged hardware-derived pair,
  records a durable three-axis blacklist and operator field-failure incident, and invalidates the
  profile set. No GPU-specific clock or voltage is hard-coded in source.
- Operator confirmation in this session upgrades the previously documented `1845@862` failure from
  historical suspicion to repeated real-use evidence. It must be marked through the new action in
  the rebuilt app before the next clean Forge evaluation; any other confirmed profile must be marked
  individually from its own card.
- Dirty build identity is now `HEAD-dirty-<content hash>` over the relevant source tree, so distinct
  local patches no longer share provenance.
- Validation: `cargo check --workspace`, core 89/89, service 386/386, gpu-nvapi 40/40,
  gpu-stress 16/16, driver-pawnio 2/2, frontend production build and `git diff --check` pass. The
  monolithic workspace-test/clippy path still hits the known Tauri sidecar `Access denied` build
  limitation; strict Clippy also reports pre-existing warnings outside this scope. No hardware write,
  Apply or Forge was performed by this implementation session.

## START-HERE (2026-07-15) — contract v17 DX11 gate + restart-safe Forge

- Qualification v17 is code-complete: exact Apply now runs Texture 5 min → native DX11 5 min →
  TransitionShock 8 min → Endurance 20 min. DX11 captures its golden at stock, explicitly selects
  the NVIDIA DXGI adapter, requires the same LUID for candidate evidence, and uses bounded completion
  polling plus deterministic readback checks. Existing gate durations were not reduced.
- This change intentionally leaves the per-bin descent hardware-derived and unchanged. A DX11
  rejection applies only to the exact candidate pair; synthesis moves to the next higher physical
  voltage bin through the existing reset-clean rejection path. Old v16 positives are readable but
  cannot unlock Apply.
- Next physical action: deploy, keep prior blacklist learning cleared for this evaluation, and run a
  clean supervised Standard Forge. Compare whether the known field-failed `1845@862` is rejected while
  safe controls pass; do not infer success from compile/tests alone.

## PRIOR CHECKPOINT (2026-07-15) — contract v16 + first hardware cycle; unaccounted TDR/reboot found

### Hardware checkpoint and operator-reported TDR
- A Standard cycle after the intentional full reset produced two run IDs: the first persisted 127
  observations and the resumed run persisted 59 more, completed the frontier and published Godforge
  `1890@893`, Brokkr's `1845@862` and Deep Calm `1740@800` under qualification contract v16.
- During the unattended descent, the operator returned to the PC at the Windows login screen and
  reports a TDR/reboot. After the app was opened again, Forge resumed from its checkpoint and later
  finished. This is useful recovery, but automatic continuation without first surfacing the crash is
  not an acceptable final safety flow.
- No persisted observation is marked `DeviceLost`/`tdr_or_crash`, and the post-reset sentinel log is
  absent. The exact active point and timestamp therefore cannot be attributed honestly; do not infer
  them from neighboring observations. The exported log's recorded-dwell table also aggregates both
  run IDs, so its apparent absence of TDR is incomplete rather than proof that none occurred.
- **P0 before unattended Forge:** persist/restore a boot or run epoch plus the active candidate,
  reconcile an unexplained restart into explicit crash evidence, stop in Needs Attention and require
  operator acknowledgement before continuing. Export must separate the current run from historical
  observations and include reconciled operator/runtime incidents.
- The long gate remains valuable: `1905@900` passed Endurance in the first run but failed it in the
  resumed run, and `1860@868` also failed late. However, the exact field discriminator `1845@862`
  passed the complete synthetic gate, so the qualifier is not yet sufficient evidence for unattended
  deployment or ordinary profile use.

### Corrected diagnosis
- The game trace proved the TDR/recovery timeline, not its internal workload cause. Lobby and match
  shared nearly the same external clock/voltage/utilization/power envelope while only the match
  failed. Sustained bin residence is therefore insufficient, and v15's stronger causal wording was
  corrected.
- `1845@862` remains durable historical field-failure evidence for this GPU. The full reset
  intentionally removed prior learning before the hardware cycle; the point is a regression control,
  not a hard-coded GPU constant in source. Its re-publication is evidence that the synthetic gate did
  not yet reproduce the real workload failure.

### Code-complete implementation exercised by the hardware checkpoint above
1. **Qualification v16 provenance** — every dwell records build SHA/dirty state, semantic workload
   fingerprint, actual backend, adapter/driver, checksum method and stock golden configuration.
   Legacy JSONL remains readable, but a positive is reusable only with current contract plus proven
   reset-to-stock and boot-flag cleanup.
2. **Deterministic stock domain** — bounded preheat requires two consecutive clean windows with
   temperature and p5 convergence. IPC/UI show Ctable (static physical table), Cboost (normalized
   live observation) and Cmax (workload-proven) separately. Missing sensors, throttle, telemetry
   stall or non-convergence fail closed before any tuning write.
3. **Power-cap hysteresis** — `>=99%` NearCap, `<=98%` OffCap, `98–99%` Ambiguous. Ambiguity repeats
   within the existing bounded p99 budget and becomes inconclusive if unresolved; numeric ratio has
   priority over `power_capped_frac`.
4. **Candidate Transaction fail-closed** — the decisive discovery attempt applies/verifies once,
   runs PowerDiscovery and boundary qualification on the same active curve, then resets/clears once.
   Bounded p99 rechecks are separate clean transactions. Qualification is persisted before discovery;
   callbacks and positives occur only after both writes and proven cleanup. DeviceLost, reset/clear,
   blacklist-save or observation-save failures cannot leave reusable positive evidence.
5. **Failure-seeking workload without per-frame serialization** — MixedGame interleaves BoostEdge,
   TextureRop and PowerRender in one frame/encoder/submit. BoostEdge/MixedGame use sparse16 GPU-side
   reduction/comparison with accumulated mismatch evidence.
6. **Sentinel ownership** — no detached canary worker and no false pre-hang deadline. The dedicated
   canary thread owns its GPU call synchronously; Event Log and boot reconciliation remain independent
   recovery nets, with an atomic cross-layer claim preventing duplicate reset/reapply. Its TextureRop
   reference is still local to that execution: useful for stochastic divergence, but not a stock-golden
   oracle and never a substitute for the exact-Apply gate.
7. **Deployability at this checkpoint** — exact-Apply Texture, TransitionShock and Endurance were
   mandatory. The newer v17 section above supersedes this with the approved additive DX11 gate.

### Next physical gate
Preserve this checkpoint, then run a supervised in-game trace of the newly published `1845@862`
profile against stock/the same known scene. A repeated field failure confirms a synthetic false
negative and should drive workload/API coverage plus the P0 restart reconciliation; survival across
repeated comparable sessions requires checking driver/workload drift before changing policy. Do not
reduce Texture/TransitionShock/Endurance until the v17 DX11 discriminator is demonstrated with
attributable provenance.

## START-HERE (2026-07-12) — pipeline completo forja↔sentinela FECHADO; próximo = re-forge de validação
Tudo commitado+pushado até `202689f`. Estado consolidado da sessão 2026-07-10→12 (a mais produtiva
até hoje — ler ESTA seção basta para retomar):

### O que está no repo e JÁ PROVADO EM CAMPO
1. **v17 sentinela runtime (2 camadas, ATIVO)** — `tdr_sentinel.rs`:
   - Camada 1: watch nvlddmkm-153 (wevtutil 15 s, zero GPU). Camada 2 (v17.2): canário TextureRop
     auto-comparado ~700 ms/20 s sob carga (util≥30%) + **watchdog de stall 3 s = detector de
     pre-hang** (age ANTES do watchdog de 2 s do driver).
   - Escada preserve-identity: +2 bins (silent) / +3 bins (TDR/pre-hang), **3 strikes** (2 bumps →
     stock + perfil limpo). Label do perfil conta a história (strike N/3); `sentinel_status.json`
     carrega recomendação em PT (card na UI Forge lê via `GetSentinelStatus`, poll 10 s).
   - Guards: FORGE_ACTIVE interlock, boot-flag, piso histórico, re-baseline pós-cooldown, dedup
     cross-layer 90 s. **Boot reconciliation** (`startup_reconcile` antes do reapply): wedge duro →
     reboot → blacklist + stock, nunca re-aplica o ponto que congelou o PC.
   - **CAMPO (2026-07-12): 5+ recuperações limpas, zero botão de força.** Pre-hang pego pelo stall
     do canário em todas. Pontos condenados pelo mundo real: 1815@843, 1815@862, 1890@900, 1890@918.
   - Console: hard-exit via TerminateProcess (loader-lock deadlock no shutdown corrigido).
2. **v16/v16.1/v16.2 gate composto (contrato qualification v14)**:
   - REQUIRED=[Texture] só (descida 60 s/bin); exact-Apply = Texture 5 min + TransitionShock 8 min
     (idle real 10-30 s → slam, detector de stall 500 ms) + **Endurance composto 20 min**: HeavySpike
     sustentado + cap-slam + FrameCadence + MixedGame + **CompositeGameLoad** (render pesado + gather
     em pool ~VRAM-cheia NO MESMO submit) + **v16.2 BoostEdge "regime lobby"** (2 segmentos, frames
     leves a centenas de fps = residência no bin do anchor — o killer de campo comprovado; NÃO
     testado em HW ainda). 9 fases; ETA na escada única.
   - Off-cap worst-case: base de potência = max p99/pico de TODO o conjunto de Apply (incl.
     Endurance/Shock) — noite fria não engana mais o teto de 188 W.
3. **Ciclo de aprendizado FECHADO (fix `202689f`)**: blacklist de campo guia a fronteira
   (BlacklistedBoundary) E o Apply — par de Apply blacklisted agora exclui+ressintetiza (o run
   18:32 morreu "parcial" porque 1905@906, condenado pelo Endurance de 11/07, abortava o publish).
   Cadeia esperada no próximo forge: 1905@906→skip, 1890@900→skip, ~1875@893 publica.

4. **Piso de tensão monotônico de campo (2026-07-12, uncommitted)** — a run de validação ainda
   publicou 1845@863 (5 bins de gap vs o 1800@875 manual) após 30 min de gate: a blacklist era
   PONTUAL (Chebyshev raio 1) mas a física V/F é regional/monotônica. Fix: `field_vf_floor_mv`
   em gpu_undervolt.rs — envelope running-max dos pontos condenados (eixos gpu_freq_mhz/
   gpu_vf_bin_mv da blacklist, mesmos da sentinela) com interpolação ceil entre clocks
   condenados; `candidate_blacklisted` agora também recusa candidato ≤ piso. Um chokepoint cobre
   descida (BlacklistedBoundary), select() pré-write e Apply (abort "blacklisted" → já exclui+
   ressintetiza via 202689f). 100% data-driven, zero constantes desta GPU; abaixo do menor clock
   condenado não há piso (fail-open honesto). Ex.: 1815@862+1890@918 condenados ⇒ piso(1845)=885
   ⇒ 1845@863 morre na síntese com 0 dwells. Semântica antiga "um clock não capa outro"
   substituída de propósito (teste reescrito: `f2_blacklist_caps_higher_clocks_but_never_lower_ones`).
   Tests service 364/0; clippy baseline. NÃO testado em HW.

5. **v16.3 cadência real no BoostEdge — DETECÇÃO, não margem (2026-07-12, uncommitted)** — raiz do
   gap "jogo condena, forja aprova": o BoostEdge caía no pacing genérico (`frames % 3`), submetendo
   frames leves ENCADEADOS com a fila cheia → fluxo contínuo de potência baixa, quase zero borda de
   corrente. O lobby real a 400 fps é CPU/engine-bound: a cada frame a GPU DRENA o pipeline, ocia
   enquanto a CPU monta o próximo, re-rampa → ~400 transições drain→idle→ramp/s NO bin do anchor
   (o dI/dt que mata undervolt). Fix em gpu-stress/lib.rs: ramo `boost_edge` faz `poll(Wait)` por
   frame + bolha sub-ms com spin (`BOOST_EDGE_BUBBLE_US`, Windows sleep é ms-coarse), cada frame
   vira uma borda discreta de boost. **Detector B** (`frame_time_degraded`, pura+testada): silício
   marginal desacelera antes de errar — frame-time médio > referência stock × 2 ⇒ Unstable (mesmo
   princípio do gate TextureStream, agora estendido ao BoostEdge). Referência nova
   `boost_frame_reference_us` no golden (captura por-frame é mais lenta que o dwell ⇒ gate é
   permissivo por construção, nunca falso-positiva). Genérico, sem constante desta GPU. gpu-stress
   13/0, service 364/0, clippy baseline. NÃO testado em HW — o re-forge é a validação.

### FERRAMENTA NOVA (2026-07-13) — game-trace: medir o jogo p/ endurecer o teste
O run limpo REBUILDADO ainda publicou 1845@862 e 1890@900 (ambos suspeitos de campo); TODA falha na
descida foi `texture-rop`, **zero `boost-edge`** — mesmo com a cadência real, o texture-rop corre na
frente e é otimista (aprovou 1815@837 enquanto o campo condenou 1815@862/843). Conclusão: o gap é
elétrico (nosso sintético é mais mole que o lobby), não só térmico. Em vez de adivinhar, medimos:
- **`NvmlSampler`** (core/nvml_gpu.rs): handle NVML persistente p/ poll rápido (power, clock, util,
  temp, throttle_bits crus). **`game-trace`** (service/game_trace.rs): logger read-only → JSONL
  (power + |ΔP/Δt| proxy de dI/dt, residência de bin V/F, throttle, tensão NVAPI amostrada a 200ms).
  CLI (`nidavellir-service game-trace [--out --secs --interval-ms --volt-ms]`) E task de background.
- **Card na UI** (Forge.svelte, padrão sentinela): toggle Iniciar/Parar + amostras/tempo/W/MHz/mV ao
  vivo + caminho do arquivo. IPC novo: `StartGameTrace`/`StopGameTrace`/`GetGameTraceStatus` +
  `GameTraceHandle` no AppState + `GameTraceStatus`/`ResponseData::GameTrace` no core. Read-only, NÃO
  no `gpu_write_requires_idle` (roda durante o jogo de propósito).
- **`scripts/dev.ps1`**: launcher de dev único — serviço elevado (cargo-watch se instalado → auto
  rebuild/restart) + UI com hot-reload (`tauri:dev`), numa janela cada (serviço admin / UI usuário).
- Validado: core 82/0, service 367/0, frontend `vite build` OK, clippy baseline. NÃO rodado em HW
  (precisa serviço elevado). **PROTOCOLO**: operador joga o lobby OW com o card ligado até crashar →
  manda o JSONL → escrevo o analisador offline (fingerprint + diff vs BoostEdge) → endurecer o teste.

### SOLUÇÃO v18 (2026-07-13) — descida LOBBY-FIRST + contrato 14→15
O game trace do 1845@862 **capturou o TDR real** (t=363s, 6min: sob carga 99% util / 144W / 65°C →
gap de 2s ≈ watchdog TDR → colapso pra idle; sentinela pegou+blacklistou). Provou: killer = residência
SUSTENTADA no bin do anchor no regime light-frame, **frio e com potência ABAIXO do nosso sintético**
(144W < 172W texrop < 200W cap) — não é potência nem calor, é o transiente no bin fixado. NVML power
é inútil pra dI/dt (p95 ΔP=0, contador cacheado); pegamos pela residência (94% em 1845, 82% em 862mV)
+ o gap de freeze.
- **Fix cirúrgico**: `V8_TEXTURE` reordenado para **LIDERAR com bloco sustentado de BoostEdge isolado
  (~44% do dwell)** — antes o texture-rop rodava primeiro e mascarava (só ~6% boost, saía cedo). Agora
  o dwell de 60s da PRÓPRIA descida exercita o regime lobby (cadência real drain-por-frame + gate de
  degradação, pré-cursor de TDR) e reprova o ponto barato; texrop + TextureStream hang-prone seguem
  depois. Sem refactor de enum; só o array do plano. Contrato `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION`
  14→15 (evidência pré-v15 quarentenada, re-forge completo obrigatório).
- Validado: gpu-stress 13/0, core 82/0, service 367/0, clippy baseline. **NÃO testado em HW.**
- **INCERTEZA HONESTA**: 26s de boost sustentado na descida (60s) podem não reproduzir um TDR que no
  jogo levou 6min — nosso sintético precisa ser MAIS duro que o lobby p/ falhar mais rápido. O re-forge
  dirá. Se não pegar 1845@862-classe na descida: (a) subir `qualification_dwell_ms`, ou (b) endurecer a
  cadência via PresentMon (frame-times reais do lobby). Piso de campo + blacklist da sentinela JÁ
  protegem 1845@862 no próximo forge independentemente disto.

### PRÓXIMO PASSO (o teste que fecha tudo)
**Rebuild (service + UI) → re-forge Standard completo.** Esperado: fronteira ~40 min (reuso), gates
com regime lobby, perfis publicados ABAIXO dos pontos condenados (Godforge ≤1875@893). Depois:
operador roda o **lobby do Overwatch** (250-400 fps) — o torture test de produção. Se segurar,
pipeline validado ponta a ponta; se cair, sentinela pega (+strike) e o forge seguinte aprende.

### Fila restante (ordem de valor)
1. **Torture test on-demand** (IPC+UI; provoca crash de propósito — exige auditoria própria).
2. Residual auditoria #4 (race last-writer no save_record, LOW-MED).
3. v15.1 rampa de P-state forçada no shock (despriorizado — lobby regime cobre o caso de campo).
4. Stage 2 preserve-identity na forja (docs/qualification-v14-endurance-plan.md, specado).
5. Ground truth do operador (régua honesta): 1815 estável ≥875? · 1890 instável até 918 · golden
   antigo 1800@875 (régua pré-v13). Blacklist de campo é a fonte viva agora.

## OLDER (2026-07-10 late) — v16 composite gate + contract v14
Committed+pushed: `d568a4c` (off-cap worst-case power fix). UNCOMMITTED on top: **v16 composite +
contract 13→14**.
- `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS = [Texture]` only (5 HW runs: Texture was the ONLY binding
  detector; standalone Transitions/Memory 5-min passes never rejected a candidate). Contract
  `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` 13→14 → pre-v14 evidence quarantined, FULL re-forge required.
- Memory's VRAM coverage folded INTO the candidate-only composite Endurance soak (two interleaved
  `VramPressure` segments at peak heat). Exact-Apply/pair: Texture 5 + Shock 8 + Endurance 20 ≈
  33 min (was 43) → ~30 min/run saved, coverage STRONGER (composite > isolated).
- ETA ladder converted to a runtime helper (`f2_apply_pair_dwell_ladder_ms`) that tracks REQUIRED.
- **v17 Stage A — runtime TDR sentinel (2026-07-11, uncommitted, NOT HW-tested)**: new
  `tdr_sentinel.rs`. Polls `wevtutil` for nvlddmkm-153 every 15 s (sub-ms CPU, ZERO GPU). On the
  FIRST in-game TDR with an F2 profile applied (boot flag NOT armed — forge dwells own their own
  recovery; DeviceLost retains the flag): stock reset → durable blacklist of the failed
  (clock,vf_bin) → auto-fallback +3 bins SAME clock (`sentinel_decide`, pure+tested) → re-apply +
  persist (`sentinel_rewrite_applied`; boot restores the SAFER point). 2nd event same session →
  stock + profile cleared (ladder exhausted). Events appended to `sentinel_log.jsonl`. Baseline =
  newest historical event at start (never re-handles old logs). Tests 362/0. Stage B pending: GPU
  canary (silent-error layer, under-load only) + UI toast + safety audit of the whole v17.
  HW-validated the same day: the 2026-07-11 run confirmed v16/v16.1/off-cap in HW (composite
  endurance REJECTED 1905@906 mid-soak; off-cap raise lines fired 3×; Godforge 1890@900 published).
  **Stage B ALSO DONE + AUDITED (2026-07-11)**: GPU canary layer — ~5 ms known-answer ALU every
  30 s, ONLY with profile applied + util ≥30% (idle never woken); non-Stable ⇒ +2-bin fallback
  (shared 1-bump/session budget with the TDR layer). Safety audit (nidavellir-safety-auditor):
  **GO WITH CHANGES — the CRITICAL was FIXED same session** (sentinel bump now routes through
  `gpu_apply::apply_and_persist_undervolt` → boot flag armed + 8 s survival window around the
  autonomous write; prior label/mem-offset captured BEFORE reset). Non-blocking residuals to
  fast-follow: (#2) coarse forge-active interlock beyond the boot flag; (#3) floor event dedup by
  service-start time if the baseline query fails; (#4) unlocked save_record last-writer race;
  (#5) cascade residue during cooldown can burn the 2nd strike. UI toast still pending.
  **Audit residuals #2/#3/#5 FIXED (same day, committed)**: `FORGE_ACTIVE` static in
  gpu_power_sweep (set around the worker) checked by BOTH sentinel layers; 19-char lexicographic
  service-start floor makes historical events inert even if the baseline query fails; post-cooldown
  re-baseline absorbs same-episode cascade residue so it never burns the 2nd strike. Remaining:
  (#4) unlocked save_record last-writer race (LOW-MED, accepted for now) + UI toast.
  Operator ground truth update (2026-07-11): the 1860@875 TDR was NOT launch/cold — several matches
  OK, then the OW lobby/practice high-load LOOP (250-400 fps light frames = sustained residency AT
  the anchor bin + kHz VRM ripple) crashed in 5-10 min WARM. Missing stressor = sustained BoostEdge
  ("lobby regime") segment in the composite Endurance — small future change; v15.1 launch-ramp
  deprioritized accordingly. For now the sentinel covers the gap by design (operator decision).
- **v16.1 ALSO DONE (2026-07-10)**: `CompositeGameLoad` workload/phase (code 13, COUNT 14) — each
  frame renders the heavy texture frame AND, in the same submit, gathers over a near-full
  VRAM-resident pool (48×256 MB OOM-guarded) → compute+texture+memory-controller on the shared rail
  SIMULTANEOUSLY. Golden = power (unchanged; gather → sink only). Replaced ENDURANCE's two
  VramPressure segments. This is the operator's "80% VRAM ao mesmo tempo que texture hops".
- Validated: workspace clean, core 82/0, service 360/0, gpu-stress 11/0, clippy baseline. NOT HW-tested.
- Operator: **Deep Calm 1755@825 currently APPLIED and validated in real use** (safe profile).
- **NEXT**: re-forge (contract 14 forces it) validates v16 + v16.1 + off-cap fix in ONE run (expect
  Godforge ≈1905, log "elevou a base off-cap", `composite-game-load` phases, VRAM ~full during soak).
  Then: v15.1 (forced P-state drop in shock), runtime TDR sentinel, on-demand torture test — each with
  a safety audit. Stage 2 (preserve-identity) lowest priority.

## OLDER START-HERE (2026-07-10) — endurance gate HW-PROVEN; v15 TransitionShock gate implemented
State: `0629a9f` (blacklist-boundary fix + v14 worst-realistic endurance) is committed+pushed and
**HW-validated by the 2026-07-10 18:26 run**: the 20-min endurance soak REJECTED Godforge candidate
1890@900 (SilentError texture-rop mid-soak — a point the old gate had just passed 3×5 min) and the
loop resynthesized to 1875@893; published Godforge 1875@893 183W · Brokkr's 1860@875 177W · Deep
Calm 1755@818 158W, all endurance-passed, run 187.9 min.

**Open problem it did NOT close**: the operator's real TDR on 1860@875 (Event Viewer: 7×
`nvlddmkm` ID 153 "BusReset TDR", ~2-3 s apart, 09/07 04:43-04:45 local, until hard wedge) is the
LAUNCH-transition class — idle P-state exit → boost VF ramp — which NO continuous dwell enters
(IdlePulse = 100 ms naps; every dwell pre-warmed 63-71 °C). Operator believes it is NOT temperature;
mechanism targeted is the transition itself.

**NEW in the working tree (validated, NOT committed, NOT HW-tested): v15 TransitionShock gate** —
see `docs/qualification-v14-endurance-plan.md` §v15 for full detail. Summary: gpu-stress
`BoostEntry` workload (golden-checked heavy slam → TRUE idle 10/20/30 s → slam; slam wall-time
> 500 ms ⇒ `stalled` ⇒ Unstable = pre-hang precursor caught below the 2 s watchdog);
`TransitionShock` pattern (~8 min) now runs BEFORE the 20-min endurance at exact-Apply;
publish gate requires BOTH (run-scoped). No contract bump. Tests: core 81/0, gpu-stress 11/0,
service 360/0; clippy baseline exact.

**NEXT (approved by operator, in order)**: (1) runtime TDR sentinel (nvlddmkm-153 watcher →
first event = reset-to-stock + blacklist + UI notice — breaks the 5-strike cascade); (2) on-demand
profile torture test (IPC+UI; covers the genuinely COLD card the forge can't reach); (3) Stage 2
preserve-identity fallback (specced in the plan doc); safety-audit the accumulated diff before the
next supervised re-forge.

## OLDER START-HERE (2026-07-09) — blacklist-abort FIXED + published; v14 endurance gate Stage 1 DONE (uncommitted)
Nothing below is committed. Two things landed this session (validated: cargo check/test/clippy green;
NO hardware run; NO safety audit yet):

1. **Blacklist-abort FIXED** (the bug the old START-HERE below describes). In the live descent
   (`run_confirmed_f2_clock_discovery`, gpu_undervolt.rs ~5066) a blacklisted NEXT candidate now sets
   `completed`/`BlacklistedBoundary` and continues the frontier instead of `aborted`/SafetyPrecheckFailed.
   Genuine Safe Mode / boot-flag refusals in `select` stay hard aborts. Regression test
   `blacklisted_next_descent_candidate_is_a_boundary_trigger`. **The 2026-07-09 03:47 run CONFIRMED it**:
   full 14-clock frontier, 3 profiles published (Godforge 1905@906 187W · Brokkr's 1860@875 176W ·
   Deep Calm 1755@818 159W), no abort, no TDR.

2. **v14 candidate-only endurance gate — Stage 1 DONE + reinforced** (`docs/qualification-v14-endurance-plan.md`).
   Operator ground truth: the published boundaries are game-honest but the forge gate is systematically
   softer than real games (repeatable ±1-bin texture-rop wall, not noise). Fix = spend realism ONLY on
   the 3 candidates. Stage 1 adds a continuous **~20-min WORST-REALISTIC** soak run at exact-Apply only,
   inside `gate_anchored_candidate_fsgl3` gated on `exact_apply` (`F2QualificationPattern::Endurance`,
   gpu-stress `Endurance` pattern). Composition: sustained max-power (HeavySpike) + cap-slam
   (HeavySpike↔IdlePulse — the 1920@918-class VRM-droop transient) + FrameCadence droop + MixedGame
   realism, with graceful golden-checked TextureRop interleaved. Harsher than a game on purpose, NOT a
   power-virus. Non-Validated ⇒ ExactApply rejected. Publish is run-scoped via
   `point_has_current_endurance_qualification` (reconcile loop's `already_qualified` also requires it →
   no resume hole). No contract bump. `F2_ENDURANCE_QUALIFICATION_DWELL_MS = 1_200_000`. Calibration
   knobs (tune on HW): HeavySpike amplitude, burst/idle ratio, FrameCadence gap.
   - **NEXT: Stage 2 (directed "preserve-identity" fallback), NOT started — mechanism fully specced in
     the plan doc.** On a GRACEFUL endurance-fail: perf (Godforge/Brokkr's) → raise to the next V-bin
     same clock (`f2_next_bin_above`), calibrate p99 + re-run the gate, then MUTATE that clock's
     `classified` point and resynth — synthesis's own off-cap gate keeps it (still off-cap) or drops the
     clock (now at-cap), so no duplicate off-cap logic. Calm (Deep Calm) → existing exclude→resynth
     already steps down. Bounded (`F2_ENDURANCE_FALLBACK_MAX_RAISES` ≈1–2; each raise ≈25 min).
     Hard aborts (DeviceLost) never fall back. **No safety gap without Stage 2** — the reinforced gate
     already makes the existing exclude→resynth converge to a worst-realistic-passing point; Stage 2
     only biases perf profiles to keep their clock. Then safety-audit the whole v14 diff → re-forge.

## START-HERE for the next session (2026-07-08, night) — runaway FIXED; NEW blacklist-abort bug to fix
Read this first. The v13 stack (clock ceiling + off-cap + single-detector + Q1) is committed & pushed
(HEAD `2662d04`). Two runs failed to publish, each a distinct, now-understood bug:
1. The **single-detector runaway** (all 67 bins, ~5 h) is FIXED (commit `a2a3ec5`).
2. The latest run (log `nidavellir-forge-log-2026-07-08T20-51-39...txt`) PROVED the runaway fix works —
   Cmax=1950 detected, floor 1755, **stopped at the 90% floor, ~36 min**, single-detector premise held
   (EVERY failure `texture-rop`), boundaries clean. BUT it aborted 1 clock short and published nothing.

### The bug to fix (blacklist aborts the frontier)
At clock 13/14 (1770 MHz) the descent found 818 mV Validated, then the next lower candidate (812 mV)
matched a **blacklisted intent** and `RealF2MultiOps::select` (gpu_undervolt.rs ~2643-2650) returned
`Err("candidate 1 intent is blacklisted")` → stop_reason `SafetyPrecheckFailed` → the forge loop treats
it as an unsafe/failed end (gpu_power_sweep.rs ~6085-6090) → **whole frontier ends "parcial", no
synthesis, no profiles.** The blacklist is DURABLE across runs (Safe Loop record) and reset-clean
texture-rop SilentErrors ARE blacklisted (every SilentError dwell carries the `blacklisted` flag). Here
the poisoning came from a PRIOR run's `1785@812` SilentError blacklisting a region that caught 1770's
next bin. So blacklist entries accumulate and eventually abort a later run one bin at a time.

- **Immediate operator workaround (no code)**: click **Reset all / "forget everything"**
  (`ResetGpuTuningFull`) — it wipes the blacklist — THEN run Standard. Within a single fresh run the
  descent reuses boundaries and should not re-poison itself, so it should complete + publish.
- **Durable fix (next session)**: a blacklisted NEXT-candidate during the frontier DESCENT is BOUNDARY
  knowledge ("don't go lower here"), NOT a safety emergency — treat it as a clean boundary (stop this
  clock at the last-good bin, continue the frontier), never abort the whole forge. Keep the genuine
  safety prechecks (Safe Mode active / boot flag armed in `select`) as hard aborts; only the
  "blacklisted intent" branch should degrade to a boundary. Cleanest: pre-filter blacklisted bins out
  of the descent candidate list so it simply stops above them. Consider also narrowing the blacklist so
  a SilentError at a HIGHER clock's voltage cannot poison the SAME voltage at a LOWER clock (lower clocks
  are stable at lower voltage), or not blacklisting reset-clean forge-descent SilentErrors at all (the
  descent already stops at the first fail). Add a regression test. Then re-forge → should publish.

### Clean boundary data from the 20:51 run (honest v13 boundaries; for Q3 calibration)
min-stable / first-fail mV per clock (Texture single-detector): 1950 931/925 · 1935 925/918 ·
1920 900/893 · 1905 900/893 · 1890 893/887 · 1875 881/875 · 1860 862/856 · 1845 856/850 · 1830 850/843 ·
1815 837/831 · 1800 825/818 · 1785 818/812 · 1770 818/(aborted). Apply = boundary +12 mV (~1 bin), e.g.
1800→~837 — still BELOW the operator's golden 1800@875, so **Q3 (silicon-margin bump to the golden)
remains the real deployability gap.** p99 at boundary ≈ 1800@825 160 W, 1860@862 172 W, 1905@900 183 W.

### Roadmap after the blacklist fix
1. Fix blacklist-abort (above) → re-forge → confirm 3 profiles publish (~1 h).
2. **Q3** — silicon-margin bump calibrated to the golden 1800@875 (frontier is ~1 bin optimistic;
   raise `APPLY_MARGIN_MV`, currently 12). Off-cap invariant + Godforge=off-cap already in.
3. **Q4** — golden-point regression gate (forge must reject 1800@868, accept 1800@875) + wire the
   failure histogram. Then real-use in-game validation (the 20-min Overwatch loop that TDR'd 1920@918).
The export-log button works well — ask the operator to attach the rich log each run.



## Ownership + tooling change (2026-07-08) — Claude owns full stack; rich forge-log export added
- **Ownership**: the Claude/Codex backend/frontend split was RETIRED (operator: it was an experiment).
  Claude now owns the whole stack incl. the Tauri/Svelte UI under `apps/ui/`. Updated CLAUDE.md,
  AGENTS.md, and the `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` header (now REFERENCE docs for the IPC surface,
  not a cross-agent handoff). Edit the UI directly; keep IPC additive/backward-compatible.
- **Rich forge-log export** (new feature): `IpcRequest::ExportForgeLog` → `ResponseData::ForgeLogExport`
  ({path, raw_observations_path, bytes, observation_count, note}). `gpu_power_sweep::export_forge_log`
  (read-only, cross-platform) reads the F2 observation store + live `PowerSweepProgress` and writes a
  timestamped `nidavellir-forge-log-<ts>.txt` under the data dir: run metadata, contract versions,
  published profiles, Cmax/floor, the full progress log, and EVERY dwell (target@anchor, outcome,
  avg/p5/p95, avg/p99/peak W, temp, pattern/verdict/failure-phase, flags). UI: "Export forge log"
  diagnostic-card button in Forge.svelte (Terminal icon) → shows the saved path. No hardware touched.
- Validation: core 80/0, service 359/0, clippy clean, `npm run build` clean (3823 modules).

## HW-run checkpoint (2026-07-08, afternoon) — single-detector RUNAWAY diagnosed + FIXED (v13.3a)
- **Run**: single-detector build ran ~5 h (13:xx→18:21) descending through ~20 clocks (1935→1650,
  "Clock 20/67") until the operator cancelled it. NEVER stopped at the 90% floor, re-descended ~25
  bins per clock from a conservative top, published nothing.
- **Root cause (bug in the single-detector commit)**: `run_confirmed_f2_clock_discovery`'s
  `has_current_full_qualification` (gpu_undervolt.rs ~5639) required ALL of
  `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS` (3) to have passed at one anchor DURING THE DESCENT — but the
  single-detector descent only runs the first pattern (Texture). So it was ALWAYS false, which made
  `sustainable = last_good_mv.is_some() && has_current_full_qualification` ALWAYS false → `cmax` (set
  only on the first sustainable clock, gpu_power_sweep.rs:6092) never set → the 90% frontier-floor
  stop (gpu_power_sweep.rs:5844, gated on `cmax.is_some()`) never fired → the descent walked all 67
  physical bins. The same flag drove `warm_start_rejected` true every clock → full re-descent each
  time (the ~25 dwells/clock, the 5 h).
- **FIX**: `has_current_full_qualification` now requires only the FIRST `qualification_passes`
  patterns (= what the descent actually runs; 1 under v13) to have passed, not all of REQUIRED. The
  full 3-pattern deployment gate at exact-Apply is unchanged. Validation: service 359/0, clippy clean.
- **Not yet re-run** — this fix restores: Cmax detected → 90% floor stops at ~1755 → ~1 h runtime →
  profiles published. Follow-up idea (defense-in-depth, deferred): an ABSOLUTE clock floor so a
  never-sustained top clock can't run away regardless of `cmax`.
- Confirmed good in this run despite the runaway: v13 ceiling held (p5=p95=target everywhere), every
  failure was `texture-rop` (+ one `compute-burst` at 1665/1650 near the bottom), zero TDR.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-08) — v13.3 single-detector descent (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- The 2026-07-08 run confirmed Texture is ALWAYS the binding detector, so the descent no longer runs
  the full set per bin. New `const F2_DESCENT_DETECTOR_PASSES = 1`; Standard/Long
  `qualification_passes = 1` → `qualify_anchored_candidate` runs ONLY the first pattern (Texture) per
  bin to find the boundary. Cuts descent from 4 dwells/bin (1 p99 + 3 v8) to 2 (1 p99 + 1 Texture) —
  roughly HALVES the descent again (est. ~2h → ~1h).
- **Deployment guarantee UNCHANGED**: the exact-Apply gate (`run_confirmed_f2_apply_qualification`)
  still runs the COMPLETE `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS` (3) on the applied point, independent of
  `qualification_passes`; both publish gates (reconciliation loop's `apply_qualified` +
  `f2_profiles_meet_qualification`'s `f2_profile_points_have_current_apply_qualification`) require it.
  A Texture-only boundary that another pattern would fail above is caught at exact-Apply → the pair
  is EXCLUDED and the loop re-synthesizes from the remaining eligible points (may pick a different
  point, or block Apply if <3 form) — never publishes the unqualified point.
- `required_confirmations` (boundary gate) now = 1, consistent with the 1-pattern descent.
  `f2_apply_upper_estimate_ms` + the in-loop ETA decoupled to `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS.len()`
  so the exact-Apply ETA stays correct (3). Validation: core 80/0, service 359/0, clippy clean.
- **Safety audit (2026-07-08): GO**, no blocking issues — deployment gate verified intact 3× (exact-
  Apply hardcodes `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS.len()` independent of `qualification_passes`; both
  publish gates + the `--confirm` hardware-apply gate require `apply_qualified`+current version).
  Applied the audit's cheap fixes: in-loop ETA under-count (concern #3) + a decoupling regression test
  (concern #2, locks descent-passes ≠ exact-Apply-passes). **Standing caveat (concern #1)**: the
  single-detector's conservatism RESTS on "Texture is always the binding detector" — HW-confirmed on
  THIS rig only (3 runs). On a different card (e.g. VRAM-weaker where Memory could bind first) a
  Texture-only boundary could ship with thinner margin (still 3-pattern-qualified, never unstable).
  **Do not generalize to other GPUs without a fresh audit / spot-check of a non-Texture pattern at the
  boundary.** If `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS[0]` ever changes, the descent silently follows it.
- **READY for the supervised re-forge** — expect ~1h, Godforge off-cap ≈1905, every descent failure
  `texture-rop`, 3 profiles published.

## HW-run checkpoint (2026-07-08) — time crushed + single-detector CONFIRMED, but a stale-const bug published ZERO profiles (FIXED)
- **Run**: 00:09→02:05 = **~1h56** (was ~4h10). High-FPS removal + Texture-first delivered the time cut.
- **Single-detector premise CONFIRMED**: EVERY descent failure this run was `texture-rop` (SilentError);
  Transitions/Memory never failed first. Safe to build the single-detector descent next.
- **v13 ceiling re-confirmed**: p5=p95=target on every dwell. No TDR.
- **BUG (regression, now FIXED): zero profiles.** `PowerSweepMode::Standard/Long` had a hardcoded
  `qualification_passes: 4` (gpu_power_sweep.rs:268/275). After HighFps was dropped the required set is
  3, so `qualify_anchored_candidate` ran 3 (take(4) saturates) but `required_confirmations =
  final_gate_passes.max(qualification_passes) = 4`, so `f2_boundary_point_is_qualified` demanded
  validation_count≥4 while the frontier could only reach 3 → `f2_regime_candidate_refusal` excluded ALL
  13 with "its own frontier boundary lacks current v8 qualification" → "nenhum candidato permaneceu".
  FIX: `qualification_passes` now ties to `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS.len()` (Standard+Long) so it
  can never desync again. Time-estimate tests recomputed (3 passes: target 210s, apply pair 915s,
  3-pair 2745s). Validation: core 80/0, service 359/0. Off-cap gate was NOT exercised (run died before
  synthesis) — next run validates it end-to-end.
- **Boundaries still ~optimistic vs golden**: 1800 boundary 825 → Apply 837 (golden 1800@875). The
  single-detector didn't move boundaries (Texture was always the binding detector). Q3 silicon-margin
  bump still pending — calibrate against the NEXT run's in-game results, don't guess now.
- **Operator request (frontend/Codex)**: a "Export full log" button (richer than console prints). Note
  in `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` later; not backend work.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-07, later) — v13.2 High-FPS removed + Texture-first (efficiency; code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- Q2 + time: across two full HW runs High-FPS was NEVER the binding detector (every boundary/Apply
  rejection fired in `texture-rop`). `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS` is now **3**:
  Texture (binding, graceful → runs FIRST so a failing bin fails after ONE dwell) + Transitions +
  Memory (VRAM-dominant, hang-prone → LAST). HighFps enum variant + workload kept (repurposable),
  just not required. `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` 12 → **13** (different pattern set →
  pre-v13 evidence quarantined; re-forge regenerates anyway).
- Time impact (est., confirm on re-forge): descent drops one 60 s dwell per PASSING bin (~25%) and a
  failing boundary bin now fails after 1×60 s not 2; exact-Apply drops one 300 s dwell per pair
  (−5 min × up to 3 pairs). Rough ~4h → ~3h. Array `.len()` auto-propagates to every completeness
  gate, so no gate logic changed. Validation: core 80/0, service 359/0, clippy clean.
- **Q1 DONE (better peak measurement)**: `is_off_cap_safe` now gates on
  `max(max_power_w, power_p99_w)` — the boundary-bin discovery peak alone underestimated the applied
  draw (measured at the LOWER boundary voltage); `power_p99_w` is the apply-bin calibrated p99 (the
  same value scoring uses, at the APPLIED voltage). Taking the higher of the two + 6% headroom is the
  conservative basis. This only ever RAISES the estimate → strictly MORE conservative than the
  audited v13.1 gate (safety-positive, no re-audit needed; excludes ≥ as many points, never fewer).
  Unknown power (both absent) still fails closed. Validation: service 359/0, clippy clean.
- STILL PENDING: **bigger time lever** = descent runs ONLY the binding detector (Texture) per bin,
  full 3-set only at exact-Apply (needs its own safety audit) — could roughly halve the run again.
  True worst-case BURST workload only if the re-forge shows a published point still exceeds the gate
  in-game (the apply-bin p99 basis should now catch the at-cap points).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-07, later) — v13.1 off-cap power invariant (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- Root cause of the Godforge 1920@918 TDR: an undervolt held AT the power cap is forced by the driver
  to droop voltage below its Vmin → crash. `synthesize_forge_profiles_capped` (gpu_power_sweep.rs)
  now excludes from ALL three profiles any point whose measured PEAK power (`max_power_w`, NOT p99)
  reaches within `POWER_HEADROOM_FRAC = 6%` of the cap. Godforge = highest OFF-CAP clock. Uses the
  already-measured peak + the live cap (`prog.power_limit_w`); on the run's data (1920 peak ~190 W,
  ceiling 188 W @ 200 W cap) 1920@918 is excluded and 1905@906 (186 W) becomes Godforge — matches the
  operator's expectation, no heavier workload needed for this case.
- 2-arg `synthesize_forge_profiles` kept as a no-op-gate wrapper (cap unknown → fail-open) so every
  test/bridge caller is unchanged; only the live F2 path calls `_capped` with the cap.
- **If EVERY qualified point is at-cap, the gate fails CLOSED** (publishes no profiles → Apply stays
  blocked) rather than ship a TDR-prone at-cap profile — honors the operator's hard off-cap invariant.
  Zero/unknown peak with a known cap also fails closed (cannot prove headroom).
- **Safety audit (2026-07-07): GO**, no blocking issues (pure additive exclusion — can only lower
  Godforge / remove points, never more aggressive; no panic; reconciliation loop still terminates).
  The audit's top concern (empty-pool fail-OPEN re-exposing at-cap) was FIXED to fail-closed above.
  Documented residuals, low real-risk on the live path: (a) `to_power_sweep_point` falls
  `max_watts`→`watts` (mean) if peak missing — live path always populates `max_watts`
  (gpu_f2_sweep.rs:126 ← gpu_undervolt.rs:1708); (b) classifier-bridge preview (gpu_power_sweep.rs
  ~2133) still uses the no-op wrapper so its Godforge preview may read the at-cap clock (read-only,
  never applied); (c) 6% headroom is single-run-derived (tunable); (d) cap read once at forge start.
- Validation: service 359/0 (+`f2_off_cap_gate_excludes_at_cap_godforge`,
  `f2_off_cap_gate_fails_closed_when_all_at_cap`); clippy clean on new code.
- Deliberately NOT in this change (future, if needed): worst-case power BURST + cap-slam resilience
  dwell (only if the peak-vs-game gap ever exceeds the 6% headroom); silicon-margin bump to the golden
  1800@875; thermal-saturation soak repurposing High-FPS; failure histogram wiring.
- NEXT: `nidavellir-safety-auditor` on this diff, then supervised re-forge — gate: Godforge lands
  OFF-CAP (≈1905, not 1920), log shows "off-cap gate excluded", no in-game TDR.

## HW-run checkpoint (2026-07-06) — v12 supervised gate PASSED: 3 profiles published, zero TDR
- **Run**: full F2 Standard forge, 05:20→09:03 (~3h43). 13 frontier points (1755–1935 MHz),
  frontier stop correct (next bin 1740 < 90% of Cmax 1935). Forge finished clean; forge_state
  saved with 13 points.
- **v12 lift confirmed**: 11 bins lifted; 1800→**875 mV** (the user's hand-validated daily
  driver) and 1830→**893 mV** — the exact values the v12 plan predicted. Regression gate holds:
  1815 publishes at 887 (>856) and 1860 at 906 (>875).
- **v12 4-pattern exact-Apply confirmed**: qualification ran High-FPS+Texture+Transitions+Memory
  4×5 min. 1905@937 passed the soak but its own v8 set raised p95 to 1935 (needs 950) → refused
  and resynthesized (designed loop worked); 1860@906 and 1770@856 then ExactApplyQualified.
- **v11 confirmed**: every failure in the run was a graceful SilentError in `texture-rop`
  (~12×); zero TDR, zero reboot, no Unstable/pre-hang verdicts needed. Held-clock thermal rule
  correctly kept thermal_throttled dwells Stable at 66–72 °C while the clock held.
- **Published**: Godforge 1860 MHz @ 906 mV (regime 1890, p99 185 W) · Brokkr's Best & Deep Calm
  1770 MHz @ 856 mV (regime 1800, p99 169 W). 1935-at-cap excluded as expected.
- **SUPERSEDED follow-up (lift ordering → v13)**: 1875@906 was EXCLUDED instead of lifted (the
  p99-calibration dwell raised its regime AFTER the lift pass). Root-cause analysis with the
  operator went deeper: the anchored plateau caps are offsets relative to the base curve, which
  the driver shifts with temperature — EVERY pair in the run measured p5/p95 = label +15/+30 MHz,
  so the delivered regime is ambient-dependent and the calm profile "1770@856" effectively runs
  ~1800@~856 when cool (operator ground truth: 1800@868 is game-unstable; 1800@875 is the
  validated point, and it was displaced into the unselected "1830 regime" rung). **Decision:
  v13 = absolute NVML max-clock ceiling (`lock_core_clock_max_mhz`) during every F2 dwell AND at
  Apply; remove the v12 lift; keep reconciliation as a dormant fail-closed net; contract bumps
  discovery 4→5 / qualification 11→12; full re-forge. Plan: `docs/clock-lock-v13-plan.md`.**
  NEXT = implement v13 phases A–C, safety audit, then the three supervised HW gates in the plan.

## HW-run checkpoint (2026-07-07) — v13 supervised gate: MECHANISM VALIDATED, profiles pending real-use
- **Run**: full F2 Standard re-forge, 01:31→05:41 (~4h10). 13 frontier points (1755–1935 MHz),
  frontier stop correct (1740 < 90% of Cmax 1935). Finished clean; 13 points saved. Zero TDR/reboot.
- **PRIMARY GATE PASSED**: every stable dwell measured **avg = p5 = p95 = target exactly** (1935/1935/1935
  … 1770/1770/1770). The v12 +15/+30 MHz thermal-shift overshoot is GONE — the NVML max-clock ceiling
  holds on driver 595.97. No dwell ever showed p95 > target (Inconclusive gate never needed); early
  ClockDrops were the real power-bound Cmax search, correct.
- **Lift removed cleanly**: zero "Regime lift" lines; Apply ladder is honest boundary + one-bin margin
  (+12/+13 mV). No reconciliation exclusions/cascade.
- **All failures graceful**: texture-rop SilentError only; 1935@925 ExactApplyRejected (SilentError) →
  resynth to 1920@918 (designed loop). 1755 warm-start fallback fired correctly.
- **Published**: Godforge 1920 MHz @ 918 mV (190 W) · Brokkr's 1905 @ 906 (186 W) · Deep Calm
  1770 @ 825 (158 W). Perf profiles rose vs v12 (1860/1770) because honest boundaries freed real
  headroom; no 1800 profile this run.
- **OPEN — the one thing to validate (bigger than usual)**: honest voltages fell far below the
  operator's Afterburner ground truth (true-1800 boundary 825 / Apply 837, vs the hand-validated
  "1800@875 stable, 868 unstable"). Expected under the v13 thesis (the old "1800" secretly ran ~1830,
  which needs more voltage), BUT hinges on whether Afterburner's fixed point is temperature-compensated
  — unprovable from logs. **Do NOT assume 837 is safe.** Discriminating test = run the exact games/scenes
  where 1800@868 failed before. Apply margin is now thin (one bin above first silent error); if real
  games show instability, FIX = raise `APPLY_MARGIN_MV`, do NOT re-introduce the lift.
- **Real-use validation (2026-07-07, in progress)**: **Brokkr's 1905@906 PASSED** 4 full Overwatch
  matches + Guild Wars 2 events + BG3 act 3. WATCH: occasional light Discord "micro-hang" cuts —
  unconfirmed whether GPU-related; could be a transient/pre-hang signature or unrelated. Operator
  continues testing tomorrow (more Brokkr's + Godforge + Deep Calm). Not yet reproduced/attributed.
- **CRITICAL HW finding (2026-07-07)**: **Godforge 1920@918 TDR'd (Render Device Lost) after ~20 min
  looping the Overwatch benchmark.** It is the POWER-BOUND top point: measured ~195 W avg, touched
  199 W / ~200 W peak; clock momentarily dropped to 1905 then re-stabilized at 1920 — oscillating at
  the 200 W cap, and a transient there killed it. Root cause = soak fidelity insufficient at the
  at-cap top: the 4×5 min exact-Apply (with stock resets between patterns) never reproduces continuous
  20-min thermal saturation + cap-slamming transients. Profiles judged "acceptable but unstable — best
  distribution so far."
- **Calibration signal (operator ground truth)**: the whole frontier is ~1–2 physical bins optimistic
  vs real-game reliability. Golden = 1800@875 stable. Operator expects roughly Deep Calm ~1755@837,
  Brokkr's ~1875+@906, Godforge ~1905@918 (1905 = last OFF-CAP clock, near a sustained undervolted
  boost — the ideal Godforge). 1770@825 is expected UNSTABLE. Direction under discussion (see below):
  regime-aware margin + thermal-saturation soak + Godforge=highest-off-cap; NOT yet implemented.
- **v13 committed + pushed (2026-07-07)** at the operator's request — considered a success so far;
  real-use validation continues before it is declared final.
- **NEXT (operator, then backend)**: (1) finish real-use validation of all 3 profiles + the
  discriminating 1800-fail-scene test + in-game ceiling-hold / idle-downclock / reboot(D1) checks;
  (2) THEN a margin-tuning review for absolute safety — either +1 voltage bin at the same clock, or
  −1 clock step at the same voltage bin (via `APPLY_MARGIN_MV`, NOT the lift); (3) confirm the
  algorithm's profile selection is within expectations for Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm
  (1920@918 / 1905@906 / 1770@825); (4) ONLY AFTER profiles+algorithm are dialed in — begin
  runtime-optimization work (shorten the ~4 h forge) while preserving discovery/qualification quality.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-07-06, night) — v13 IMPLEMENTED: absolute clock ceiling (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- Phases A–C of `docs/clock-lock-v13-plan.md` are in the working tree (NOT committed):
  1. `RealF2Ops::apply_positive_offset` sets `lock_core_clock_max_mhz(target)` after a successful
     VF write (both anchored and simple arms) — covers EVERY dwell (discovery, v8 qualification,
     p99 calibration, exact-Apply). Lock failure ⇒ `ApplyFailed` ⇒ step motor resets (the shared
     `gpu_power_sweep::reset_to_stock` already released the lock at :4113; `gpu_apply::reset` at
     :260 likewise — no reset-path change was needed).
  2. `apply_anchored_undervolt` sets the ceiling after `AnchoredRaiseVerified`; ceiling failure ⇒
     reset_and_confirm + Err (no apply without ceiling). Covers user Apply + reapply-on-boot.
  3. Classifier: new `F2_CLOCK_CEILING_TOL_MHZ = 15`; sustained p95 > target + 15 ⇒ Inconclusive
     (ceiling didn't hold; evidence describes a different point — the GPU did nothing wrong).
  4. Contracts: `F2_DISCOVERY_CONTRACT_VERSION` 4→5, `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` 11→12 —
     ALL pre-v13 evidence (shifted +15/+30 regimes) quarantined; full re-forge required.
  5. v12 regime lift REMOVED from `apply_f2_margin_policy` (returns no messages);
     `f2_regime_support` reconciliation + exact-Apply resynthesis KEPT as dormant fail-closed nets.
     Lift test replaced by `f2_margin_policy_v13_never_lifts_and_reconciliation_refuses_failed_ceiling`.
- **Validation**: `cargo check --workspace` clean; tests 488/0 (one legacy fixture updated to
  ceiling-held clocks); clippy baseline-only in touched files. No hardware touched.
- **Safety audit (2026-07-06)**: `nidavellir-safety-auditor` → **GO with changes**. No blocking
  issues: no residual-lock exit path, both apply sites fail-closed, classifier ordering correct,
  contract quarantine holds. **N1 (medium) FIXED**: unconditional `reset_core_clock_lock()` at the
  top of `reapply_on_boot` (gpu_apply.rs) — the driver-resident lock would otherwise survive a
  service restart WITHOUT a reboot through the early-return guards (armed flag / Safe Mode / no
  profile). **N2 (low, deferred)**: `f2_regime_support` uses strict `> target` while the
  classifier tolerates +15 — only a benign false-REJECT in the 1-bin jitter band; align to
  `F2_CLOCK_CEILING_TOL_MHZ` only if HW gate (b) shows p95 != target. **D1 (doc)**: the
  "locks don't survive reboot" premise must be confirmed during gate (c): set lock → reboot →
  `nvidia-smi -q -d CLOCK` shows stock boost before the service starts.
- **NEXT**: the three supervised HW gates (plan §D3): (a) manual `nvidia-smi -lgc 210,1800`
  sanity under load, (b) re-forge Standard with the primary gate "Brokkr's/Deep Calm publish
  ≈1800@~875", (c) Apply + reboot gate (+ D1 check). Then commit.
- Minor, log-only: duplicated consecutive `forge_state saved` lines during p99 calibration
  retries (07:59:24, 08:00:10, 08:00:56) — harmless.

## Backend fix (2026-07-06, post-commit) — console shutdown handler (committed 6551997)
- Console mode had no Ctrl+C/close handler: the main thread blocks in `ConnectNamedPipe` and
  worker threads keep the GPU saturated, so teardown stalled on driver DLL detach (Ctrl+C and
  "End task" looked dead for a long time). New `console_shutdown` module in `main.rs`:
  `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` signals every motor's cooperative stop (same path as IPC Stop → dwell
  cancels within a band, resets to stock, clears boot flag), waits a bounded 30 s grace polling
  the forge's `running`, then exits; second Ctrl+C forces immediate exit. Grace expiry exits
  anyway — an armed boot flag is the Safe Loop recovery's designed input. Added
  `Win32_System_Console` feature. Tests 357/0.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-07-06, late) — v12: regime LIFT + exact-Apply 4-pattern fix (HW-VALIDATED by the 2026-07-06 run above)
- **Run finding 1 (bug)**: exact-Apply ran only 3 patterns (`gate_anchored_candidate_fsgl3` was
  called with a hardcoded `final_gate_passes = 3`) while the p95/p99 publish gates require the
  complete 4-pattern set — 1875@925 passed 15 min of soak and was refused as "sem p95 sustentado
  mensurável". Fixed: the call now passes `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS.len()`.
- **Run finding 2 (design)**: the strict p95 reconciliation excluded 11/13 candidates again — but
  the log showed the excluded-with-reason voltages were exactly right: lifting 1800's Apply to the
  1830-regime requirement gives 875 mV = the user's hand-validated daily driver. **v12 replaces
  exclude with LIFT**: `apply_f2_margin_policy` now (a) records `base_apply_mv` (boundary+margin,
  new additive `PowerSweepPoint` field), (b) lifts `vf_table_voltage_mv` to the sustained regime's
  required voltage computed FROM BASE APPLIES — lifted values never feed requirements, so lifts
  cannot cascade (the lifted extra on target S covers S's own overshoot, which a lower target's
  hardware never reaches). `f2_regime_support` also reads `base_apply_mv` (fallback to
  `vf_table_voltage_mv` for legacy), so the strict reconciliation stays as a fail-closed net that
  lifted points satisfy by construction. Top-of-frontier points with NO measured regime above are
  still excluded (future: direct regime confirmation dwell). Lift runs BEFORE the p99 backfill, so
  lifted pairs get their own calibrated power like any pair.
- **Expected next run**: lifted Apply ladder (e.g. 1800→875, 1830→893, mid/top pairs at the
  sustained-regime voltages), 3 profiles synthesized, exact-Apply 4×5 min per selected pair.
  1935-at-cap remains excluded by target-residency Inconclusive (power-bound; known, conservative).
  1875 boundary 912 was a non-monotonic outlier vs 1890@906 — watch it; isotonic outlier handling
  is a possible follow-up.
- **Validation**: workspace 488/0 (new lift + no-cascade unit test). No hardware touched. Safety
  audit still pending for v11 A2/A3/C1 + this v12 gate change before commit.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-06) — v11 qualification engine hardening (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Why**: the v10 run traded graceful silent errors for straight TDRs (2 in one run, e.g.
  1920@906 boot-flag crash) and froze Discord voice at each burst — replacing the L2-resident
  TextureRop with the memory-latency version removed the wrong-pixel detector AND made frames
  giant non-preemptible draws.
- **B1**: TextureRop reverted to the v9 L2-resident form (the proven graceful detector).
- **B2/A1**: the scattered VRAM sampling moved to a NEW `TextureStream` workload/phase (code 11,
  own golden `RenderGoldens.stream`), rendered in 16 scissor BANDS with one submit each — the
  driver can preempt between bands (desktop/audio responsive) and each band is timed.
- **A2 (two layers)**: (1) a band exceeding `STREAM_PREHANG_BAND_MS = 500` fails the dwell as the
  new `StabilityResult::Unstable` BEFORE the ~2 s driver watchdog (partial frames are never
  checksummed); (2) the existing `prehang_stall_detected` NVML-starvation signal (recorded since
  v6, log-only) is now a failing verdict in `classify_f2_stress_dwell` for qualification dwells.
- **A3**: golden capture now also returns avg frame time; `RenderGoldens.stream_frame_reference_ms`
  is the stock reference — sustained stream frame time beyond 2× reference fails the bin as
  Unstable (marginal silicon slows before it hangs). `capture_one_golden` returns
  `(checksum, avg_frame_ms)`.
- **B3**: severity ladder — hang-prone detectors (VramPressure, TextureStream) run LAST in
  V8Texture/V8Memory; graceful detectors kill bad bins cheaply first (unit-tested ordering).
- **C1**: crash-proximity margin in core synthesis: `frontier_entry_for_target` refuses a boundary
  closer than `F2_CRASH_PROXIMITY_MIN_MV = 12` (~2 physical bins) above the target's highest
  crash/TDR anchor (`crash_floor_for_target`, pure + tested) — a TDR at V taints V+1 even if it
  passed, per the observed reality that the silent-error threshold above a crash went undetected.
- **Contract v11**; `StabilityResult::Unstable` added (legacy F1 matches map it as non-crash
  failure). Validation: workspace 487/0; clippy clean on new code. No hardware touched.
- **Safety note**: A2/A3/C1 change verdict/gate semantics — run `nidavellir-safety-auditor`
  before merge/commit.
- **HW gate (manual)**: rerun Standard. Expect: TextureRop silent errors return as the primary
  killer (graceful, early); Discord/desktop responsive during TextureStream; log shows Unstable
  verdicts (pre-hang/degradation) instead of TDRs; any TDR that still happens must push the
  boundary ≥2 bins above it in synthesis. Regression table gate unchanged (1815@856 & 1860@875
  must be rejected; 1800 boundary near the user's known ~875).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-05, late) — 1.7 texture-stream + 1.8 upward recovery, contract v10 (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Why**: the 2026-07-05 HW run + user ground truth (1800@875 stable daily; 1800@868 and 1830@875
  UNSTABLE in game) showed v9 still ~4-5 bins optimistic (approved 1815@843, 1860@875) — and 1800
  was discarded whole because the warm-start entered below the real boundary. Ground-truth table
  lives in `docs/qualification-v8-plan.md` ONLY as a validation gate — never hardcoded.
- **1.7 (gpu-stress)**: TextureRop (the empirically sensitive detector — every v9 failure fired in
  `texture-rop`) now samples a large VRAM-resident source: fixed 8192² RGBA8 (256 MB, size fixed —
  NOT runtime-probed — so golden capture and qualifier can never diverge on size), GPU-filled via
  hash shader (`TEXTURE_STREAM_FILL_SHADER`), and the tap chain start is SCATTERED per pixel
  (sin-hash of frag coords) so neighbouring fragments hit far-apart texels → bilinear taps pay DRAM
  latency: TMU + memory controller together, the game texturing path. Same source in
  `capture_one_golden`. `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION = 10` (v9 positives are the proven false
  negatives; they cannot unlock Apply).
- **1.8 (service)**: two fixes. (a) `warm_start_rejected` now requires a bin with the FULL required
  pattern set passed — a single-pattern pass (High-FPS ok, Texture failed) no longer suppresses the
  conservative fallback; `sustainable` uses the same full-set check. (b) New bounded upward
  recovery in the outer ladder: a `QualificationRejected` end (NOT ClockDrop) re-runs the clock one
  physical bin above the last attempted start, up to `F2_START_RECOVERY_MAX_CLIMBS = 4` (generic
  search parameter). Pure helper `f2_next_bin_above` + test.
- Earlier same day: IPC freeze fixed (`ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED` treated as success; handle closed on
  connect error) — `ipc_server.rs`.
- **Validation**: workspace 486/0; clippy clean on new code. No hardware touched.
- **HW gate (manual)**: clear forge state → Forge Standard → the run must now (a) REJECT 1815@856
  and 1860@875-class points (expect `texture-rop` failures at higher voltages than v9), (b) land
  the 1800 MHz boundary near the user's known ~875 (climb log lines "recuperação para cima" prove
  1.8 fired), (c) TextureRop frame times will be longer (memory-latency bound) — watch for TDR
  margin; per-frame work is bounded but untested on HW.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-05) — Phase 1 complete: v8 workloads full set, contract v9 (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Why**: v8 with FrameCadence alone still passed points the user knows crash in-game. Completed
  the full Phase 1 workload set from `docs/qualification-v8-plan.md`.
- **New workloads** (`gpu-stress`): `VramPressure` — up to 8×256 MB VRAM-resident tables (OOM-guarded
  via error scopes, degrades gracefully), cache-defeating gathers cycling tables per dispatch,
  known-answer verified (any mismatch = silent error). `GeometryDepth` — 49 152 procedural triangles
  × 8 instances under a depth test (unique per-triangle depth ⇒ deterministic image), loads vertex
  fetch/raster/depth-ROP; golden-verified (`RenderGoldens.geometry`, 5 goldens captured now).
- **Patterns renamed V7→V8** (labels `v8-*`) and extended: HighFps/Transitions +GeometryDepth,
  Texture +VramPressure, and NEW `V8Memory` pattern (VRAM-dominant, all 11 phases). Qualification
  set is now **4 patterns** (HighFps/Texture/Transitions/Memory): boundary 4×60 s, exact-Apply
  4×5 min (upper estimates updated: target 275 s, apply pair 1 220 s).
- **Core**: `F2QualificationPattern::Memory`; canonical `REQUIRED_QUALIFICATION_PATTERNS: [_; 4]` —
  all completeness gates (p99/p95 at anchor, frontier qualification count) now index into it, so
  extending the array tightens every gate automatically. `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION = 9`.
  Item 1.5: pure `qualification_failure_histogram()` aggregates failed dwells by
  (clock, mV, pattern, failure_phase) — data source for future pattern weighting/adaptive margin;
  log/UI wiring deliberately deferred.
- **Item 1.6 verified, no change needed**: golden-mode MixedGame decomposes into
  BoostEdge/TextureRop/PowerRender (each golden-checked); ComputeBurst is known-answer.
- **Validation**: workspace 485/0 tests; clippy baseline only (0 warnings in new code). No hardware
  touched.
- **HW next (manual)**: clear forge state → Forge Standard → confirm 5 golden captures + 4 patterns
  run (look for `vram-pressure`/`geometry-depth` phases in JSONL) → re-test the known-unstable
  points that v8-cadence-only still passed; they must now be rejected (likely in `vram-pressure` or
  `frame-cadence` phases). VramPressure on cards < 4 GB and the geometry golden determinism across
  driver versions are the untested risks.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-04) — qualification v8: FrameCadence phase (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Why**: v7-passing points still crash/TDR in real games. Root-cause analysis (see
  `docs/qualification-v8-plan.md`, item 1.1): the v7 patterns never exercise VRM droop-release
  transients at game frame cadence — idle pulses fire every 750 ms while games oscillate load every
  6–16 ms, which is where undervolt Vmin actually fails.
- **What**: new `VfWorkload::FrameCadence` + `VfQualifierPhase::FrameCadence` (code 8, label
  `frame-cadence`) in `gpu-stress`: one heavy RENDER_SHADER frame at 1 instance (~10-20 ms of work =
  a game frame) → poll(Wait) → sleep gap cycling 2/4/6/8 ms, repeating. Each frame is a heavy burst;
  the gap sweep crosses different VRM response periods. Golden-verified with its OWN stock checksum
  (`RenderGoldens.cadence` — the 1-instance image differs from the 8-instance power golden);
  `capture_fsgl3_render_goldens` now captures four goldens.
- **Patterns**: FrameCadence segments inserted into all three plans — HighFps ×2, Texture ×1,
  Transitions ×3. Coverage denominator is now pattern-specific via new pure
  `qualifier_expected_phases()` (legacy FSGL = 8 phases, v7 plans = 9); the old fixed
  `EXPECTED_PHASES = 8` + `[false; 8]` would have panicked on phase code 8. A v7-pattern run that
  skips FrameCadence is Inconclusive.
- **Contract**: `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION = 8` — pre-cadence positives cannot unlock Apply;
  negatives stay conservative. Discovery contract (v4 PowerRender) untouched.
- **Validation**: `cargo check --workspace` clean; `cargo test --workspace` 484/0 (core 78, gpu-stress
  40, service 355); clippy shows only the pre-existing baseline. No VF write, Forge, Apply or GPU
  stress was run.
- **HW next (manual, user-run)**: clear persisted forge state → run Forge Standard → confirm the four
  golden captures succeed and the three patterns execute FrameCadence phases (look for
  `frame-cadence` in phase metrics/JSONL), then re-test the known game-crashing point: v8 should
  reject it at the voltage v7 accepted.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-07-04) — held-clock thermal rule for exact Apply (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Why**: a full run ended with ZERO profiles. The power-bound top point `1935 MHz @ 956 mV` (pinned
  at the 200 W cap) failed exact-Apply as `ExactApplyInconclusive` — three HighFPS dwells tripped NVML
  `thermal_throttled` from a memory-junction hotspot at only ~67-69 C core, while the card actually
  HELD >= 1935 MHz with no silent error and full coverage. The guardrail rejected evidence where the
  card never left the qualified point.
- **Fix (two layers, must stay in sync)**: a thermal-slowdown flag disqualifies exact-Apply stability
  only when p5 sagged below target beyond 30 MHz (`F2_CLOCK_DROP_TOL_MHZ`). (1) classifier
  `classify_f2_stress_dwell` (`ApplyQualification` arm), (2) publish gates
  `apply_qualification_p99_at_anchor` + `current_apply_qualification_p95_clock_at_anchor` via new
  `apply_qual_reading_trustworthy` (`f2_observation.rs`). Fails closed on unknown clock.
- **Kept strict**: PowerDiscovery power calibration (`f2_power_measurement_usable`,
  `current_discovery_observation_at_anchor`) still rejects any throttle — a throttled sample understates
  the V<->W map.
- **Safety**: audited SAFE twice (`nidavellir-safety-auditor`). Publish aggregation is max-only, so a
  held-throttled reading can only raise published wattage (never understate) and raise p95 (stricter
  voltage reconciliation). Triad completeness / reset-clean / boot-flag untouched.
- **Validation**: core 78/0, service 355/0. No VF write, Forge or Apply run automatically.
- **NEXT**: user runs a controlled rerun to confirm 1935 @ 956 mV now advances
  HighFPS->Texture->Transitions and publishes. Changes are in the working tree on `master`, NOT
  committed — rebuild picks them up.

## Latest backend/frontend checkpoint (2026-07-03) — stage-aware Forge time model
- **Structured plan:** progress now publishes Cmax, the inclusive 90%-floor real clock, real-clock
  count and a conservative absolute total ceiling. All fields are additive/defaulted.
- **Phase-aware ceiling:** pre-Cmax remains explicitly `Refining`; post-Cmax uses the exact physical
  domain. Frontier discovery/qualification, possible three-attempt p99 backfills and up to three
  exact-Apply v7 pairs are accounted separately, then tightened as each stage becomes concrete.
- **UI:** Forge Progress separates live remaining, estimated run total, maximum estimated total and
  elapsed wall time, with readable stage copy and no inference from technical logs.
- **Safety/status:** progress-only change. No tuning algorithm, qualification decision, hardware
  write or Safe Loop behavior changed; no Forge was run automatically.

## Latest backend/frontend checkpoint (2026-07-03) — qualification v7 + cooperative cancellation
- **Automated oracle:** Standard/Long use three deterministic patterns targeting high frame cadence,
  texture/ROP/mixed graphics pressure and rapid load transitions. Each retains stock-golden
  verification; older FSGL evidence is excluded from v7 Apply.
- **Strict regime:** synthesis uses measured p95, not p5, to identify electrical support. Any higher
  sustained regime must have a measured target/Apply anchor and all three current qualification
  patterns; no one-bin alias tolerance remains.
- **Responsive Stop:** cancellation reaches discovery and qualification render/compute loops,
  prevents new bounded batches, returns through normal checked stock reset and cannot blacklist or
  validate the interrupted point.
- **UI/IPC load:** refresh cycles do not overlap; secondary diagnostics poll every 3 s during Forge;
  Stop displays `stopping` immediately; live log payload is capped at 240 lines while JSONL evidence
  remains complete.
- **Hardware status:** code/tests only. No VF write, Forge or Apply was run automatically.

## Latest backend/frontend checkpoint (2026-07-01) — confirmed sustained-p99 frontier/calibration (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Workload unchanged**: live F2 discovery still uses the textured, bounded-frame `PowerRender`;
  compute-only `POWER_SHADER` was not substituted.
- **Discovery v4 telemetry**: mean, sustained p99 and raw maximum watts persist separately, with
  maximum temperature, NVML thermal-slowdown, measured-voltage and render coverage evidence. An
  anomalous adjacent-bin p99 in the same p5 regime repeats the exact bin up to three total attempts;
  two readings must agree and the highest measured p99 is retained. No consensus is ineligible.
- **Applied-bin truth**: after the unchanged +12 mV margin snaps to a physical bin, synthesis resolves
  that exact bin's current PowerRender observation. Selection and cards use its p99 plus apply-bin p5;
  mean/raw maximum remain diagnostic. If warm-start skipped the exact target/apply pair, Forge now
  backfills it with discovery-only PowerRender under the same v4 p99 consensus; no FSGL3 rerun.
  Missing/current-invalid p99 still fails closed with no profiles.
- **Boundary**: any discovery `ClockDrop` still at 99%+ of the cap by p99 is
  `PowerBoundClockDrop` and continues voltage descent, including after a prior sustained point.
  `Validated` at cap also continues; Standard/Long only launch FSGL3 from a confirmed off-cap bin.
- **Compatibility**: discovery contract is v4; qualification remains FSGL3 contract v4. v3 positives
  and unconfirmed power telemetry cannot enter new synthesis/resume; negatives stay conservative.
  Apply rejects any restored F2 profile without valid p99.
- **Hardware checkpoint**: a Standard run held p99 near the 200 W cap and continued 1950 MHz from
  1150 mV through 950 mV, where discovery first validated. FSGL3 A then reset-clean rejected that
  target on the unchanged heavy-phase p5 guardrail. A control-flow bug incorrectly ended the entire
  ladder; the rejection now completes only 1950 MHz so lower clocks can discover the qualified Cmax.
- **Hardware next**: rerun Standard and confirm the ladder advances below a reset-clean rejected clock,
  then compare the forged apply-bin p99/raw peak against the known game scene.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-30) — margin boundary + continuous recovery (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Margin stop**: equivalent FSGL3 heavy phases produce one robust p5 per dwell; A/B histories stay
  separate. `MARGIN_DROP_TOL_MHZ = 30` requires two prior stable references before the relative arm,
  while the existing target-minus-30 arm remains available.
- **Ambiguity**: two same-point retries use 1.5× dwell. Exhaustion records Inconclusive, completes the
  current clock safely and continues the outer frontier; it neither marks the point bad nor claims
  qualification.
- **Recovery**: 0x116/0x117 are OC/TDR classes. Exact `f2_undervolt_probe` TDR/Unknown events do not
  advance Safe Mode; unrelated crashes do. DeviceLost no longer increments before startup recovery,
  and blacklist insertion is idempotent and scoped to the exact F2 intent.
- **Resume/final state**: persisted mode is a stable `fast|standard|long` id. Restored `interrupted`
  state triggers one automatic non-destructive Reset+Start on UI reconnect. `finished` is emitted only
  for complete qualified profiles; Fast is `provisional`.
- **Apply margin**: `APPLY_MARGIN_MV = 12` snaps to an exact higher physical bin. Additive
  `boundary_voltage_mv` and `apply_margin_mv` preserve transparent boundary/apply semantics.
- **Pre-hang**: 300 ms missing-valid-sample stall is recorded/logged only. No concurrent reset was
  added; activation waits for hardware calibration plus cooperative cancellation.
- **Hardware**: not run. Gate must check margin ClockDrop frequency, clock-to-clock continuation,
  repeated TDR recovery, reconnect resume and the applied margin bin in game.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-30) — FSGL3 golden-sample qualification (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **Battery**: added FSGL3 A/B plans, positional REDUCE3, deterministic stock-golden capture and
  per-frame on-GPU comparison. Golden mode runs six-frame bursts separated by 4 ms; legacy
  FSGL1/FSGL2 still use the unchanged REDUCE/self-reference/250 ms path.
- **Forge wiring**: Standard/Long capture power, boost and texture/ROP goldens after stock reset and
  seed derivation, with one fresh `GpuCtx` per configuration. Capture failure aborts safely. Goldens
  thread through `run_confirmed_f2_clock_discovery` to `single_qualifier_dwell` and never persist.
- **Default and Apply gate**: `qualify_anchored_candidate` now constructs FSGL3 A/B purposes.
  `F2_QUALIFICATION_CONTRACT_VERSION = 4`; only current FSGL3 A+B evidence unlocks Apply.
- **Validation so far**: `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo test
  --workspace`, `npm.cmd run build`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` and `git diff --check`
  pass. Clippy reports only the existing baseline warnings. Hardware validation remains pending.
- **Hardware next**: clear persisted Forge state, then confirm FSGL3 rejects 1920 MHz @ 912 mV and
  1935 MHz @ 918 mV before any Standard/Long acceptance or in-game comparison.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-29) — Cmax descent interleaves qualification per VF bin (code-complete, NOT HW-tested with new flow)
- **Why**: discovery descended `PowerRender` to the deepest survivable bin then qualified THAT (most
  aggressive) bin with the failure-seeking loop — risking a TDR during qualification and wasting the
  descent below the bin that ultimately qualifies. Operator asked to interleave: qualify the first
  sustained point, then descend one bin at a time, gating each step by qualification.
- **What** (`crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs`, `run_confirmed_f2_clock_discovery`): for Standard/Long,
  the per-clock loop now PowerRender-descends to the first under-cap `Validated` bin, qualifies it with the
  full N passes (new helper `qualify_anchored_candidate` returning `F2QualificationOutcome`), and only then
  steps one real VF bin lower (PowerRender measures its power and gates the next qualify). First
  qualification failure stops the descent, keeping the last qualified bin. The heavy qualifier never runs
  more than one bin below a proven point. The old descend-to-floor-then-qualify-deepest + upward back-off
  is removed. Fast (qualification_passes==0) is unchanged (provisional descend-to-PowerRender-floor).
- **Downstream unchanged**: a failed qualification writes an `is_bad()` observation, so
  `last_discovery_good_for_target`/`first_bad_for_target` already select the deepest QUALIFIED bin. Locked
  by new core test `interleaved_qualification_failure_selects_shallower_qualified_point`. Cmax/90% floor,
  synthesis, Safe Loop arm/verify/reset per dwell, resume/warm-start untouched.
- **Trade-off**: N passes × each qualified bin → longer Standard/Long; initial ETA under-counts and
  self-corrects upward (contract note added for Codex).
- **Validation**: `cargo check` clean; core 69 + service 319 tests; clippy no new warnings in touched
  files. **No hardware run with the new flow.** NEXT = one supervised Standard run; inspect that the
  qualifier only runs at/one-bin-below proven points and that a deeper rejection keeps the bin above.
  Recommended `nidavellir-safety-auditor` pass on the diff before commit.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-29) — Safe Mode unstick: Reset clears the latch + deep reset (Fix A/B/C HW-CONFIRMED by operator)
- **HW update**: operator rebuilt + ran in console; logs show a prior armed boot-flag recovered
  (blacklist+recede, consecutive_crashes accounted) and "Reset all" then cleared `forge_state` and a
  fresh F2 forge ran — "funcionou perfeitamente". The stuck-Safe-Mode / Needs-Attention dead-end is
  resolved on the rig. (Fix C clean-shutdown marker not separately stress-tested.)
- **Why**: operator reported the app stuck in Needs Attention / Interrupted with "no option," surviving
  manual PC restarts; the new Reset all did not release Safe Mode. Root cause: `safe_mode` is a one-way
  latch — `gpu_apply::reset` (the `ResetGpuTuning` body, gpu_apply.rs:236) reset hardware + boot-flag +
  applied profile but **never rewrote `safe_loop.json`**, and nothing anywhere set `safe_mode=false`.
  Plus each clean reboot in Safe Mode re-ran `EnterSafeMode` and incremented `consecutive_crashes`, and
  a manual restart during an armed boot-flag was counted as a crash.
- **Fix A** (`crates/core/src/safe_loop.rs` + `crates/service/src/gpu_apply.rs`): new
  `SafeLoopRecord::clear_recovery_latch()` (safe_mode→false, consecutive_crashes→0, state→idle, PRESERVES
  blacklist/last_validated/crash_log); `reset()` now load→clear_recovery_latch→save before clearing the
  boot-flag. The existing Reset all button now releases Safe Mode (no UI change).
- **Fix B** (`safe_loop.rs` + `safe_loop_runtime.rs`): new `RecoveryAction::RemainSafeMode` for a clean
  boot already in Safe Mode — stays hands-off without incrementing the streak. `EnterSafeMode` (the
  incrementing path) is now only the armed-flag threshold trip.
- **Fix C** (`safe_loop.rs` store + `safe_loop_runtime.rs` + `service_impl.rs`): graceful service
  Stop/Shutdown writes a one-shot `clean_shutdown.txt`; startup consumes it and treats armed-flag +
  marker as a clean interruption (no crash). Fail-closed: no marker ⇒ crash, parachute intact.
- **Deep reset** (`crates/core/src/ipc.rs` + `ipc_server.rs` + `gpu_apply::clear_all_learning`): new
  additive IPC `ResetGpuTuningFull` = `ResetGpuTuning` + wipe blacklist (record→default), F2
  `f2_observations.jsonl` and `gpu_knowledge.json`. UI button requested from Codex (contract 2026-06-29).
- **Validation**: `cargo check` clean; `nidavellir-core` 68 + `nidavellir-service` 319 tests pass; clippy
  no new warnings in touched files. **No hardware / VF write / apply / stress / reboot exercised.**
- **NEXT**: (1) supervised manual check — force Safe Mode, confirm Reset all returns to a forgeable state
  and survives a reboot; confirm a clean restart mid-forge no longer adds a crash; (2) Codex wires the
  Full reset button; (3) recommended `nidavellir-safety-auditor` pass on Fix C before commit. Nothing
  committed or pushed.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-29) — FailureSeekingGameLoop VF qualification
- `run_render_stress` remains the unchanged eight-instance `PowerRender` used by discovery, benchmark
  and legacy callers.
- `run_vf_qualifier_stress` executes PowerOpening, BoostEdge, HeavySpike, TextureRop, ComputeBurst,
  IdlePulse, MixedGame and PowerClosing. Each phase has independent checksum/coverage evidence; the
  failing phase is logged.
- Only the Standard/Long reset/reapply qualification motor selects the transient workload. Fast,
  CLI probes and all discovery candidates keep the steady workload.
- Mixed qualifier p5 cannot create `ClockDrop`; `Pass`/`Fail`/`Inconclusive` coverage is persisted in
  `f2_observations.jsonl`. Current Apply qualification counts only current-contract qualification
  passes, not discovery/legacy positives.
- Qualification rejection backs off to the next physical VF bin and performs fresh `PowerRender`
  discovery before restarting all passes. No manual bad-point registry was added.
- `ResetGpuTuning` is an explicit recovery escape hatch after TDR/interruption: it bypasses the normal
  start/apply lease, stops marked-running work, resets stock, clears Safe Loop, and releases the F2
  Forge handle after reset succeeds. It also removes the visible `forge_state.json` checkpoint so the
  UI can return to an idle/new-run state without deleting automatic F2 observation history. The Forge
  worker also catches panic/unwind so `running` is not left true forever.
- UI recovery is wired: after TDR/Needs Attention/Interrupted, **Recover & continue** calls
  `ResetGpuTuning` and then starts the selected Forge mode, preserving F2 observations for backend
  resume. **Full reset** is separate and maps to `ResetGpuTuningFull` with destructive confirmation.
- Crash, `SilentError`, `Unstable`, reset and Safe Loop behavior remain fail-closed.
- Code/unit validation only. No VF write, confirmed Forge, apply, reboot or GPU stress was executed.

## Latest backend/UI checkpoint (2026-06-28) — durable learning and visible progress
- Qualification refinement: frontier extended to 90% Cmax; next-clock warm-start is one real bin above
  the prior minimum with conservative ClockDrop fallback; Fast profiles are explicitly provisional.
- Standard = 10 s discovery + 2×60 s qualification; Long = 10 s discovery + 3×120 s qualification.
  Qualification failure backs off one physical bin and restarts all passes. UI and backend both block
  F2 Apply until qualified.
- The 18:08–18:27 Fast Forge preserved 72 observations (37 at 1935 MHz, 35 at 1920 MHz). The apparent
  loss was the UI restoring only the last complete forge state.
- Root cause of the stop before 1905 MHz: reset-clean SilentErrors incremented
  `consecutive_crashes`; the third-clock preflight then refused the run. Fixed so only DeviceLost/TDR
  increments crash streaks.
- Live progress now checkpoints each completed dwell and exposes structured current clock/voltage,
  completed/estimated steps, ETA, last outcome, learned count and frontier-complete status.
- Lower clocks warm-start at the prior target's last power-bound ClockDrop, with one conservative
  overlap. Technical log lines stream per candidate and remain visible after the run.
- Validation: `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` 311/311; `cargo check -p
  nidavellir-service`; `apps/ui npm.cmd run build`. No new hardware Forge was run.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-28) — integrated F2 frontier corrected; ready for supervised hardware QA
- Live path: `PowerSweepHandle::start_with_mode` → `measure_multiclock_undervolt_forge` →
  `run_confirmed_f2_clock_discovery` → the proven per-candidate
  arm→anchored-write→verify→dwell→checked-reset motor.
- Highest real clock is tried first. A pre-sustain clock drop near 99–100% power cap continues down
  voltage; off-cap failure advances the clock. First sustained target = Cmax. The outer loop then
  covers all real bins through 90% Cmax.
- Autonomous target/ladder/live discovery traverses the physical VF domain with no 3/6-step budget.
  Stop is the first terminal signal or hardware floor; `DeviceLost`/reset failure aborts the Forge.
- Fast/Standard/Long use the same frontier: provisional 10 s discovery / 2×60 s qualification /
  3×120 s qualification. Confidence uses actual dwell, samples, and independent validations.
- Observations are appended immediately and keyed by NVML UUID. Resume skips confirmed bins and
  known brackets. Only a complete Cmax→90% frontier can produce the active profile set.
- Safety: global IPC GPU lease, checked modern VF reset, Safe Loop arm-before-write, boot flag retained
  through crash accounting, no auto-apply.
- Validation: workspace check; core 64 / NVAPI 40 / service 309 tests; diff check clean. Read-only
  dry-run at 1950 MHz reports ceiling 1950 and 83 physical anchors (no 3/6/+210/+15 discovery cap).
  Repository-wide rustfmt remains a pre-existing baseline failure, so no broad rewrite was accepted.
- Hardware checkpoint protocol: operator present and prepared for TDR/reboot; start with Fast only if
  explicitly authorized; inspect Cmax, every per-clock stop reason, reset readback, Safe Loop state,
  observation checkpoints, and absence of profile persistence on interruption before Standard/Long.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-27) — F2 PHASE 2: Apply path wired to F2 anchored undervolt (code-complete, NOT HW-tested)
- **What**: the three Apply actions (`ApplyPowerGodforge/Brokkrs/DeepCalm`) now APPLY the F2 undervolt
  instead of refusing it. Closes the Phase-1 gap (forge produced F2 profiles that could not be applied —
  apply was attached to F1 flatten-down, the wrong op for an undervolt point).
- **Scope (operator-confirmed)**: WIRE the apply only; F2 is the main algorithm but **F1 was NOT removed**
  (still the live path for legacy `is_undervolt==false`). Advisory: `synthesize_forge_profiles` + `ForgePolicy`
  are SHARED by F2 — must stay; the now-dead F1 apply/forge code (`apply_core`/`apply_vf_ceiling`,
  `run_power_sweep`/`build_frontier`) is kept for a separate Phase 3 cleanup.
- **How (reuse, not reinvent)**: new `gpu_undervolt::apply_anchored_undervolt(target_mhz, anchor_mv)` reuses
  the proven `RealF2Ops` primitives for a one-shot apply (prev_offset=0): read live VF base →
  `select_anchor_bin` → `apply_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` → `verify_anchored_positive_offset`. ONLY
  `AnchoredRaiseVerified` leaves the curve applied; any miss/anchor-fail/writer-reject → `reset_to_stock` +
  per-bin readback confirm + `Err` (fail-closed, nothing left applied). `gpu_apply::apply_and_persist_undervolt`
  mirrors `apply_and_persist` (arm boot flag → write → persist → clear flag after 8 s survival window) and
  persists a new `AppliedProfile.undervolt: Option<UndervoltApply{target_mhz, anchor_mv}>` (`#[serde(default)]`,
  legacy JSON → None). `reapply_on_boot` branches on `undervolt` (F2 re-derives the anchored curve from the
  LIVE table and requires the exact validated anchor bin (missing bin → fail closed; never silently deeper);
  F1 unchanged). IPC: `ApplyPower*` route via `apply_forge_profile` on `prog.is_undervolt`
  (F2) else `apply_power_profile` (F1, unchanged); `refuse_undervolt_apply` removed.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/{gpu_undervolt.rs, gpu_apply.rs, ipc_server.rs}`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` (Backend→Frontend 2026-06-27: apply WIRED, UI must un-gate).
- **Apply axes from the forge point**: `target = target_clock_mhz ?? clock_mhz`,
  `anchor = vf_table_voltage_mv ?? voltage_mv` (`undervolt_apply_params`, unit-tested). Survives restart:
  whole `PowerSweepProgress` incl. `is_undervolt` round-trips through `forge_state.json` + seeds the handle.
- **Validation (no hardware)**: cargo check clean; tests **core 61 / nvapi 38 / service 300**; clippy
  ZERO new service warnings (the 3 introduced clone-on-Copy fixed;
  remaining 21 are pre-existing). NOT run: any apply / VF write / `--confirm` / hardware.
- **NEXT**: independent `nidavellir-safety-auditor` pass on the diff (recommended), then ONE supervised
  manual apply on the rig — forge F2, click Apply, confirm: anchored VF write verifies, `gpu_applied.json`
  carries `undervolt`, survives the 8 s window, reapplies on next service start; reset clears it.
- Integrated into the master closeout; final validation and publish proof are recorded in `memory.md`.

## Latest frontend checkpoint (2026-06-27) — Phase 2 F2 Apply un-gated; contract evidence wired
- F2 Godforge / Brokkr's / Deep Calm remain visible as **Discovered** until applied; Apply is now enabled
  and calls the unchanged `ApplyPower*` methods. The existing Active state takes over after success.
- Applied-state matching uses the F2 target clock + anchor carried by `GpuApplyStatus.core`; legacy F1
  matching remains unchanged. The read-only legacy curve verifier reports F2 as metadata-only rather than
  running the F1 flatten-down classifier against an anchored curve.
- `PowerSweepPoint.confidence` / `validation_count` and
  `PowerSweepProgress.power_bound_collapse` are now structured, backward-compatible payload fields.
- The Phase 2 safety closeout also resets to stock if memory-offset application fails after the F2 core
  write, preserving the contract that a failed apply leaves no F2 curve resident.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-27) — FORGE → F2 UNDERVOLT pivot; Phase 1 DONE (e4bd006, pushed); next = Phase 2
- **Why**: 2 supervised HW runs proved the live button's F1 multi-clock forge COLLAPSES on the RTX 3060 Ti —
  it's pinned at 200 W, and F1 flatten-down can't lower power on a power-bound card (lowering a frequency
  ceiling does nothing when already power-capped). F2 anchored undervolt CAN: 1800 MHz @ 875 mV = 157 W vs
  200 W (−43 W, same clock). Operator call: forge's PRIMARY method pivots to F2. Full rationale + the verified
  gap analysis = top entry of `decisions.md`.
- **Reuse map (don't reinvent)**: motor `run_confirmed_f2_multi_step` (gpu_undervolt.rs:1362); ladder
  `run_anchored_ladder_sweep` (gpu_undervolt.rs:2657); synthesis bridge `learned_frontier` →
  `frontier_to_points`/`to_power_sweep_point` (f2_observation.rs:371/394) → `synthesize_forge_profiles`
  (gpu_power_sweep.rs:1284); persist `save_forge_state` (gpu_power_sweep.rs:340). F2 writer for Phase 2 apply:
  `apply_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` (gpu-nvapi). The GAP: F2 wired only to the CLI (gpu_undervolt.rs:1792);
  the button (`run_power_sweep`:3811) + Apply IPC (`apply_core`→`apply_vf_ceiling`, gpu_apply.rs:99) are F1.
- **F2 brings learning/memory F1 lacked**: observation store records every sweep across runs; learned_frontier
  accumulates; descent resumes from deepest validated; confidence grows with validations (resolves the Option-A
  IDLE gap).
- **Phase 1 — DONE + pushed (`e4bd006`)**: `measure_multiclock_undervolt_forge` (gpu_power_sweep.rs:4100)
  drives the F2 motor per clock via `run_confirmed_f2_clock_descent` (gpu_undervolt.rs:2863, reuses the motor
  unchanged) → `learned_frontier` → `frontier_to_points` → `synthesize_forge_profiles` → 3 profiles → persist.
  Button routed via `start_with_mode` (gpu_power_sweep.rs:253). Apply GATED: additive `is_undervolt` flag
  (ipc.rs) + `refuse_undervolt_apply` (ipc_server.rs:384) in all 3 ApplyPower* handlers. F1 `run_power_sweep`
  kept `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Mode → clock breadth only. Verified: tests core 61 / nvapi 38 / service 296;
  safety audit GO; reset-on-every-path; no auto-apply. Contract note implemented by Codex: the UI shows F2
  profiles as Discovered and disables Apply in Phase 1. **NOT hardware-tested** — a supervised button run
  on the rig is safe (apply gated) and
  is the recommended first check next session.
- **Phase 2 (NEXT — start here)**: wire the F2 writer `apply_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` (gpu-nvapi,
  today called only from gpu_undervolt.rs:1792) into the Apply IPC (`apply_power_profile`/`apply_core` route
  F2 picks to the anchored-offset writer instead of the F1 `apply_vf_ceiling`), with Safe Loop arm/verify/
  persist/reapply-on-boot; then flip `refuse_undervolt_apply` to allow F2. RISKIEST piece → own safety audit +
  supervised HW run before shipping. **Phase 3**: fold Fast/Long modes into F2 depth, reapply-on-boot, retire
  F1 button path.
- **Git note**: abandoned F1 knee-seeking commit `cc8710a` dropped (F1-specific, moot under F2; reflog-recoverable
  in the diagnosis worktree). The F2-pivot decision/plan is re-recorded here + `decisions.md` (the diagnosis
  session's local plan commit `02e07c2` was not pushed; its substance is preserved here).

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-26) — F1b BUTTON MODES (Fast / Standard / Long) — committed 3c82e96 + pushed; HW test pending
- **What**: DEFERRED #1 from the Option-A checkpoint — the live power-sweep button gains TWO new modes
  around the proven Standard run. FAST = quick discovery (fewer probes, shallower); LONG = broader+deeper
  discovery + repeated per-pick ceiling soaks (confidence built in ONE session, no IDLE wait). The
  multi-clock analogue of F2's `--validation-passes` depth knob.
- **STATUS: committed `3c82e96` + pushed to master** — cargo check clean; `core 59 / nvapi 38 / service 293`
  tests pass (+1 new); clippy ZERO new warnings (the two `too_many_arguments` are pre-existing
  `build_frontier_two_phase` / `real_probe_step`). NO hardware run yet — one supervised test of the button is
  pending (see MANUAL TEST PATH).
- **Design — Standard is byte-identical to the just-HW-validated button** (pinned by a new test
  `power_sweep_mode_tuning_preserves_standard_and_bounds_fast_long`): the plain `StartPowerSweep` IPC still
  maps to `BUTTON_MAX_PROBES=24` / per-target `3` / one 35 s ceiling soak. FAST = `12 / 2 / 1` (≈half the
  discovery). LONG = `40 / 4 / 3` (more clocks + one deeper bin + 3× ceiling soaks per pick). All knobs are
  named consts in `gpu_power_sweep.rs` (easy to tune).
- **Backend**: `PowerSweepMode {Fast,Standard,Long}` enum + `mode.tuning() -> (max_probes,per_target,passes)`;
  `PowerSweepHandle::start_with_mode` (plain `start` delegates to Standard); `run_power_sweep(.., mode)` builds
  `FrontierLimits` from the mode and loops the ceiling soak via new `validate_pick_ceiling_passes` (fail-closed
  on ANY pass; passes clamped to `POWER_SWEEP_MAX_VALIDATION_PASSES=5`). Mode label + per-profile pass count
  surfaced in `note`/`log` text only (no payload change).
- **IPC (additive, backward-compatible)**: two NEW unit methods `StartPowerSweepFast` / `StartPowerSweepLong`
  in `core/ipc.rs` + dispatch arms in `ipc_server.rs`. `StartPowerSweep` UNCHANGED (= Standard). No payload/
  field change → no contract break. UI toggle documented for Codex in `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` (2026-06-26
  request), realising the `validation_passes` "IPC parameter when wired" the 2026-06-23 entry anticipated —
  delivered as a BOUNDED mode, not a free-form integer.
- **Safety (self-audit)**: `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone` / Safe Loop arm-clear / `reset_to_stock` / verifier /
  the probe + soak motor are all UNTOUCHED. The per-pick fail-closed 35 s ceiling soak runs ≥1× in EVERY mode
  (no weakening). FAST only REDUCES exposure. LONG adds MORE probes/soaks of the SAME bounded fail-closed
  motor — a longer supervised run, no new risk class; the global `max_probes` stays a hard cap; extra passes
  can only REJECT a marginal pick, never widen it. NO auto-apply (apply stays the separate `ApplyPower*` IPC,
  "confirme em jogo"); persist still only when `godforge.is_some()`. An independent `nidavellir-safety-auditor`
  pass is recommended before any confirmed LONG hardware run.
- **Files**: `crates/core/src/ipc.rs`, `crates/service/src/{gpu_power_sweep.rs, ipc_server.rs}`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`.
- **DEFERRED (unchanged)**: #2 IDLE / cross-run multi-clock confidence accumulation (operator: later).
- **MANUAL TEST PATH (hardware, operator-present)**: send `StartPowerSweepFast` or `StartPowerSweepLong` (or
  plain `StartPowerSweep` for Standard). Watch `note`/`log` for the mode label, `est_wall_s`, and (LONG)
  `passagem i/N` lines. Restores stock at the end; persists `forge_state.json` only on a usable profile.
- **TO RESUME**: code is committed + pushed; remaining = (a) one supervised hardware test of the button on the
  test rig (confirm multi-clock button → 3 profiles → apply end-to-end; LONG also exercises multi-pass ceiling
  validation), then (b) DEFERRED #2 (IDLE / cross-run). Optional independent safety audit before the HW run.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-23) — OPTION A: live power-sweep BUTTON rewired to the multi-clock forge algorithm — pushed
- **What**: the live "forjar/refinar" button (`StartPowerSweep` → `run_power_sweep`, `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`)
  was SINGLE-CLOCK; it now runs the MULTI-CLOCK forge algorithm (the proven `build-frontier` core) and produces the
  3 DIFFERENTIATED profiles (Godforge / Brokkr's 95% / Deep Calm 90%) via `synthesize_forge_profiles`.
- **STATUS: committed + pushed** — commit `ba48c7c` (code, +423/−380) on top of Codex's UI commit `837ab4c`; this
  handoff is the follow-up docs commit. Verified: cargo check clean; tests `nvapi 38 / core 59 / service 292` pass;
  clippy no new warnings; `build-frontier` dry-run byte-behavior-preserved (hardware-relative targets, floor
  discovered). Independent safety audit = GO-with-changes, and BOTH flagged fixes were applied (below). NO hardware
  run yet — the button has NOT been exercised on real hardware (see MANUAL TEST PATH).
- **How it works**: extracted `measure_multiclock_forge(store, stop, limits) -> Option<MultiClockForgeResult>` (the
  confirmed `build-frontier` core: derive_core_seed → regime(PowerLimited) → hw_floor → `candidate_clocks` (hardware-
  relative, NO fixed MHz) → derive_descent → plan_frontier → real_probe_step probe → build_frontier_two_phase →
  synthesize). `run_build_frontier` refactored to call it (dry-run output byte-identical). `run_power_sweep` calls it
  with BUTTON-default `FrontierLimits` (`BUTTON_MAX_PROBES=24`, `BUTTON_MAX_PROBES_PER_TARGET=3`, all else off),
  surfaces `est_wall_s` BEFORE the run (~8–12 min), maps the 3 profiles, validates each pick, persists on success.
- **Two safety fixes applied after the audit**:
  1. APPLY-AXIS: picks come from `probe_to_point` with `voltage_mv=0` (undervolt is in `vf_table_voltage_mv`); the
     Apply path keys on `voltage_mv` → `choose_ceiling_mv(curve,0)` = LOWEST bin = WRONG deepest undervolt. FIX:
     backfill `voltage_mv = vf_table_voltage_mv` on the 3 picks before validate/persist (`run_power_sweep` ~3814).
  2. VALIDATION FIDELITY: new `validate_pick_at_ceiling` (~3613) soaks each pick AT ITS DISCOVERED CEILING (arm Safe
     Loop → `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone(vbin, clk)` → read-only verify → 35 s game-power soak → reset+clear on EVERY
     path → fail-closed DROP the pick on any instability; no back-off). Multi-clock picks route here; `None`-ceiling
     legacy picks keep `arduous_validate`.
- **Safety invariants (verified)**: reset-to-stock on EVERY exit path (start / fail-closed `None` / post-validate);
  persist (`save_forge_state`) ONLY when `godforge.is_some()`; NO auto-apply (apply stays the separate `ApplyPower*`
  IPC, "confirme em jogo"); NO IPC contract change (`deep_calm` becoming `Some` is additive); `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone`
  / F1 / Safe Loop untouched.
- **HONEST CORRECTION on IDLE / learn-over-time**: the multi-clock frontier confidence is PER-RUN (in-run telemetry
  quality `s.confidence`), NOT cross-run. The single-clock `GpuKnowledge` (cross-run trials → `gpu_knowledge.json`)
  was the only cross-run learner and was REMOVED from the button (offset-keyed, single-clock-specific; struct kept
  test-only). So the button does NOT learn across runs today; cross-run/IDLE accumulation for the multi-clock
  frontier is a FUTURE item (operator confirmed IDLE = later, not priority).
- **DEFERRED — next-session work (operator's plan)**:
  1. TWO BUTTON MODES: a **LONG** run (everything + the bigger validations in ONE session — skip IDLE, for users who
     want it all up front) and a **FAST** run (quick discovery; leave confidence-building to IDLE / later manual runs).
     This is the multi-clock analogue of the `--validation-passes` depth knob; needs a UI toggle (→ Codex contract) +
     a backend depth parameter (likely vary `BUTTON_MAX_PROBES`/`max_probes_per_target` + per-pick soak passes).
  2. IDLE / cross-run learning: accumulate stability confidence across runs on the multi-clock frontier (keyed by
     clock+voltage, persisted), feeding the Wilson gate — the future auto-runs-when-idle scheduler builds on this.
- **MANUAL TEST PATH (hardware, operator-present)**: click the live power-sweep button (`StartPowerSweep`) to run the
  multi-clock forge end-to-end; OR CLI `build-frontier --confirm` (discovery only, no persist). The button shows the
  duration estimate first, then 3 differentiated profiles, restores stock at the end, persists `forge_state.json` only
  on success. Capture service log lines `multiclock-forge:` / `build-frontier probe:` / `Validação árdua`.
- **TO RESUME**: pick up the two button modes (#1) — the smaller, higher-value next step — before IDLE (#2). Optional
  before that: one supervised hardware run of the button to confirm the multi-clock flow end-to-end on the test rig.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-23) — F2 multi-clock profile package (Brokkr's 0.95 + descending ladder + confidence opt-in) — pushed
- **What**: 3 approved changes toward the v0.5 multi-clock profile frontier. Implemented by the code-surgeon,
  independently validated + safety-audited (GO). No hardware run. Committed + pushed to `origin/master`:
  `f065d4a` (code) + `79c3081` (docs).
- **THE margin answer**: applied-voltage conservatism (e.g. 906 mV vs the 868 the sweep reached) is the **Wilson
  confidence gate** (0.85), NOT a margin. `synthesize_forge_profiles` selection is voltage-agnostic; a once-validated
  deep point has confidence ~0.21 and is filtered until it earns repeat confirmations.
- **Part 1**: `ForgePolicy::balanced` Brokkr's floor 0.98→0.95 (Deep Calm 0.90, gate 0.85 unchanged) — selection
  only. 3 floor tests decoupled to explicit 0.98; new test pins 0.95.
- **Part 2 (Caminho B)**: `ladder_target_descent_bounds` makes `run_anchored_ladder_sweep` direction-aware —
  DESCENDING starts at the prior clock's last-good (ceiling) with the base floor (each lower clock finds its own
  deeper min-V); ASCENDING unchanged. Confirmed loop chains `prev_good` forward.
- **Part 3**: `--validation-passes N` (default 1, cap 20) confidence opt-in for `--auto-sweep` — re-validates ONLY
  the deepest validated point up to N-1 extra times (reuses the safe motor + per-pass precheck, stops on any
  non-Validated, records 1 obs/pass). Default 1 = no-op. Mode 1 kept; idle-validation = FUTURE.
- **UI contract**: `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` (2026-06-23) — multi-clock profiles, Brokkr's 95%, honest
  collapse, confidence-is-a-gate messaging, "Build confidence now" opt-in (default OFF), idle future.
- **Validation**: nvapi 38 / core 59 / service 292 pass; clippy no new warnings; dry-runs confirm default +30 &
  manual-prior +250 unchanged, auto-sweep shows +210 horizon + validation-passes line, descending ladder plans
  per target. Safety audit = GO (8/8 PASS).
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/{gpu_power_sweep.rs, gpu_f2_sweep.rs, gpu_undervolt.rs}`, `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`.
- **MANUAL TEST PATH (available now, no button needed)**: everything above is in the service CLI. Read-only
  dry-runs (safe, no hardware): `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --auto-sweep [--validation-passes N]` and
  `undervolt-probe --ladder-sweep --targets 1830,1815,1800,1750,1700` — both print the "classifier bridge"
  block (`synthesize_forge_profiles` with Brokkr's 0.95, read-only). On the current single-clock store it shows
  the honest collapse. To see the 3 profiles DIFFERENTIATED you need multi-clock data → run the confirmed
  descending ladder (`… --confirm`, HARDWARE, operator-present, never HW-run before), then re-run the dry-run.
- **DEFERRED — Option A: wire the live forge/refine button to the multi-clock algorithm (F1b Phase 2)**. The
  operator deferred this until usage limit returns. Goal: the button (`StartForgeAll` → the live power-sweep at
  `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs:3770`) should run a MULTI-CLOCK sweep (a few descending clocks anchored
  at the validated top) and select via `synthesize_forge_profiles(&frontier, &ForgePolicy::balanced())` instead
  of today's single-clock `select_brokkrs_v2` (line 3799) + max-voltage Godforge (3788) + Deep Calm=None (3802).
  Key facts for resuming cold: (a) the live forge is SINGLE-CLOCK today, so a naive selector-swap would COLLAPSE
  (`distinct_clocks<=1`) and DEGRADE the working button + change the applied/persisted profile — it must become a
  real multi-clock sweep; (b) types match (`ForgeProfiles` fields are `Option<PowerSweepPoint>`, same as the
  payload) → NO IPC contract change; (c) it makes the button a LONGER hardware run and touches apply/persist
  (`ApplyGodforge`, `save_forge_state`) → needs care + a safety audit before any confirmed run. Until then, the
  CLI manual-test path above is the way to exercise the new algorithm.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-22) — F2 LEARNED OFFSET HORIZON implemented (+210 abs / +15 step); HW run HELD
- **What**: target-sweep-specific progressive absolute-offset horizon. Commit `c40a78d`
  (`feat(service): add f2 target sweep learned offset horizon`), pushed to `origin/master`. No hardware run executed.
- **Change**: gpu-nvapi gains `TARGET_SWEEP_HORIZON_MAX_MHZ = +210` + `PositiveOffsetLimits::target_sweep_learning_horizon(floor, ceiling)`
  (abs +210, per-step STILL +15 — unlike `manual_prior`, which widens both). Only the `--auto-sweep` dispatch in
  `gpu_undervolt.rs` builds it; default/ladder/manual-prior keep `conservative` (+30/+15). `gpu_f2_sweep.rs` dry-run
  names the horizon cap + shows per-candidate step delta. 8 new tests. Files: `crates/gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs`, `crates/service/src/gpu_f2_sweep.rs`.
- **Validation**: cargo check clean; gpu-nvapi 38 / core 59 / service 284 tests pass; clippy zero new warnings;
  independent safety audit = **GO** (all 11 items PASS; no unsafe clock/floor bypass; no single +210 jump — ~14
  validated +15 steps; confirmed sweep still bounded by `F2_CONFIRMED_MAX_STEPS`=3; no profile persist).
- **Dry-runs (no --confirm)**: default still `abs +30 / +15` (unchanged); manual-prior still `+250` (unchanged);
  `--auto-sweep` shows `abs +210` horizon, resumes from prior validated 962 mV/+30, PLANS 6 candidates continuing
  below 962 (#4 962/+45, #5 956/+45, #6 950/+60; each step Δ ≤ +15).
- **Why the HW run was HELD (operator choice)**: today's live curve has THREE bins within +30 at the top
  (981/+15, 975/+15, 968/+30), so a confirmed run — capped at 3 candidates, descent restarting from the curve top —
  would reach only **968 mV** (shallower than the 962 frontier) and would NOT advance discovery. The +30 cap is NOT
  today's binding limit; the 3-step budget + descent-start is. Spending a TDR-risk run to re-validate known-good
  points is poor value. (Safety auditor independently flagged the same — its C1.)
- **State (untouched)**: no `--confirm` run; observation store still 8 records / `last_good 962 mV` / `first_bad None`;
  no `gpu_applied.json` / `boot_flag.json`; no profile apply/persist/promotion. Implementation pushed to `master`
  (worktree branch `claude/adoring-lewin-2a7c8b`); tree clean after the docs commit.
- **NEXT**: scoped, separately-reviewed follow-up — let the confirmed sweep RESUME ITS DESCENT START near the
  validated baseline (skip already-validated shallow bins) so the deep candidates (962/+45, 956, 950) fall within
  the 3-step budget; THEN one supervised confirmed run actually advances the frontier. Alt: bounded LADDER over
  1815/1830.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-22) — F2 1800 MHz second confirmed chained run; frontier saturated at +30 cap — PASS
- **What**: third confirmed official target sweep (`undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --auto-sweep --confirm`)
  at HEAD `01b97ca`. One confirmed command, operator present. No code change (hardware validation only).
- **Result — PASS** (exit 0): **3/3 Validated**, `CompletedAllPlanned`. #1 981/+15 (1815/1815, 191 W),
  #2 975/+15 (1803/1800, 198 W), #3 968/+30 (1815/1815, 193 W). All reset + boot-flag cleared; no TDR/crash/
  DeviceLost/Unstable/ClockDrop. `first_bad None`, frontier updated, ended safe.
- **Key finding**: the 1800 MHz conservative sweep is now **absolute-cap-bounded**. This session's VF read sat
  higher (boost top 1935), so the deepest reachable bin within the **+30 abs cap** was 968 mV/+30; the next
  needs +45 → fail-closed. The chained baseline relaxes only the PER-STEP cap, never the ABSOLUTE cap, so it
  can't push below ~962 mV. `last_good` stays **962 mV** (prior run's deeper point). The frontier has hit its
  conservative floor — re-running 1800 only adds confidence/observations.
- **State after run (all safe)**: `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` ABSENT; `forge_state`/`gpu_knowledge`/
  `heartbeat`/`safe_loop` byte-identical; `f2_observations.jsonl` 5→8 (7 validated + 1 preserved abort). git
  clean.
- **NEXT**: stop re-running 1800 (saturated); start a bounded LADDER over additional targets (1815/1830) to
  build the real multi-clock frontier — supervised, one confirmed run at a time.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-22) — F2 CHAINED DESCENT refinement + first FULL-descent HW run (1800 @ 962 mV) — PASS
- **What**: the planner refinement the PASS-PARTIAL run called for, committed `fcdf04d`
  (`feat(service): refine f2 target sweep descent baseline`), then its first confirmed hardware run
  `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --auto-sweep --confirm`. One confirmed command, operator present.
- **Fix**: observation-aware chained same-target descent. The confirmed motor bounds each candidate's per-step
  increase against the LAST VALIDATED offset (prior candidate this run — only reached after it validated — or
  the deepest prior validated same-target/same-GPU observation for candidate 0; 0 when none), not stock +0.
  The absolute +30 cap still bounds each candidate's absolute offset. Files: `crates/core/src/f2_observation.rs`
  (`validated_descent_baseline` + tests), `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (`chained_prev_offset`,
  `RealF2Ops.prev_offset_mhz`, `RealF2MultiOps.baseline_offset_mhz`, `run_anchored_target_sweep`),
  `crates/service/src/gpu_f2_sweep.rs` (dry-run "chained baseline" line). **gpu-nvapi / apply_vf_ceiling_monotone
  / verifier / manual-prior UNCHANGED.** Tests: core 59/0, service 282/0, gpu-nvapi 33/0.
- **Result — PASS** (exit 0): **3/3 Validated**, `CompletedAllPlanned`. #1 975/+15 (avg 1803, p5 1770, 198 W),
  #2 968/+15 (1800/1800, 190 W), #3 **962/+30** (1800/1800, 191 W) — the +30 point that aborted before now
  validates. Min stable voltage **962 mV** (was 975), `first_bad None`, frontier updated, ended safe.
- **State after run (all safe)**: reset + boot-flag cleared for all 3; `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json`
  ABSENT; `forge_state`/`gpu_knowledge`/`heartbeat`/`safe_loop` byte-identical (no persist/apply/promote, no
  new blacklist); `f2_observations.jsonl` 2→5 records (prior 2 incl. the old abort preserved). `git` clean.
- **NEXT**: bounded LADDER over multiple targets (real multi-clock frontier), supervised, one confirmed run
  at a time.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-22) — F2 OFFICIAL target sweep FIRST HARDWARE RUN (1800 @ 975 mV) — PASS-PARTIAL
- **What**: first bounded hardware run of the OFFICIAL F2 target sweep (progressive anchored descent, NOT
  manual-prior): `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --auto-sweep --confirm` at HEAD `8dbd296` (freshly-built
  debug binary). One confirmed command, operator present, no second run.
- **Result — PASS-PARTIAL** (exit 0): #1 **Validated** 975 mV / base 1785 / +15 → 1800; **RaiseVerified**;
  dwell **Stable** avg/p5 **1815 MHz**, **191 W**. #2 **aborted_by_safety_gate** (planner per-step +30 > +15
  cap; **no VF write**, `not_run`). `last_good=975`, `first_bad=None`, frontier updated. No TDR/DeviceLost/
  Unstable/ClockDrop/reboot.
- **State after run (all safe)**: `reset_to_stock_ok` + `boot_flag_cleared` true for both candidates;
  `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` ABSENT; `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/`heartbeat.txt`
  byte-identical; `safe_loop.json` content unchanged (`safe_mode=false`, blacklist 4 entries unchanged). 2
  observations appended to the now-existing `f2_observations.jsonl`. `git` clean.
- **Key finding (algorithm, NOT changed)**: each candidate starts from stock (+0); with the +15 per-step cap,
  only base-within-+15 (1785) is reachable, so the deeper anchors (base 1770, +30) self-abort and the 1800
  sweep validates ONE point per run. To bracket the min stable voltage the planner must carry the prior
  validated offset as the next baseline (or widen the same-target descent step) — a future reviewed task.
- **NEXT**: planner refinement for same-target descent, then re-run the 1800 sweep to bracket below 975 mV.

## Earlier backend checkpoint (2026-06-22) — F2 discovery/learning algorithm IMPLEMENTED (not yet HW-validated)
- **What**: the four-block F2 discovery/learning algorithm. **Code + tests + docs only — no hardware, no
  `--confirm`, no VF write, no profile apply/persist/promote.** Commits `0df6179` (store + target sweep),
  `cb125b6` (ladder + learned frontier).
- **Files**: `crates/core/src/f2_observation.rs` (NEW — pure store/queries/frontier/bridge),
  `crates/core/src/lib.rs` (module), `crates/service/src/gpu_f2_sweep.rs` (NEW — mapper/recorder/
  formatters/ladder helpers), `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (CLI args/parse/dispatch +
  run_anchored_target_sweep + run_anchored_ladder_sweep + usage), `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`
  (classify_f2_frontier_summary read-only classifier bridge), `crates/service/src/main.rs` (module).
- **CLI**: `undervolt-probe --auto-sweep` (same-target min-stable-voltage discovery; official progressive
  caps; bounded by F2_CONFIRMED_MAX_STEPS; records observations on --confirm only) and `--ladder-sweep
  --targets a,b,c` (multi-target; lower target's last-good used only as a conservative FLOOR; stops on
  safety failure). Dry-run default; both write nothing.
- **Learning**: observations → `f2_observations.jsonl` (JSONL, append-only, learning data NOT a profile);
  `learned_frontier()` derives per-target best/first-bad/bracket; `classify_f2_frontier_summary` bridges to
  the EXISTING `synthesize_forge_profiles` (read-only preview of Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm — nothing
  applied). last_good = lowest validated anchor; first_bad = highest failure; instability that resets clean
  is learning data, not a safety failure (only ResetFailed/crash stops a sweep/ladder).
- **Untouched**: default progressive + manual-prior; F1/build-frontier; apply_vf_ceiling_monotone; Safe
  Loop; reset_to_stock; verifier; synthesize_forge_profiles (reused). v1 GPU-only; CPU/RAM/UI deferred.
- **Validated (no HW)**: core 56/0, service 278/0, nvapi 33/0; clippy clean; all dry-runs write nothing
  (`f2_observations.jsonl`/`boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent).
- **NEXT**: first bounded hardware run of the official target sweep — `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800
  --auto-sweep --confirm` (operator present). NOT another manual validation.

## Earlier checkpoint (2026-06-21) — F2 MANUAL-PRIOR anchor mode HARDWARE VALIDATED (1800 @ 875 mV, +210) — PASS
- **What**: opt-in `--manual-prior` for `undervolt-probe` — anchors at an explicit `--start-mv` with a
  SEPARATE larger bounded offset cap to validate a KNOWN point fast (`1800 MHz @ 875 mV`). NOT the default,
  NOT for unknown GPUs. **Code + tests + docs only — no hardware, no `--confirm`, no VF write.**
- **Files**: `crates/gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs` (+`PositiveOffsetLimits::manual_prior`),
  `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (planner + formatter + refusal + dispatch + 13 tests),
  `crates/service/src/main.rs` (doc comment only).
- **Default unchanged**: progressive anchored descent + conservative caps (+30/+15) are the official
  unknown-GPU path. Manual-prior branches BEFORE the default dispatch (gated on `args.manual_prior`).
- **Cap**: `F2_MANUAL_PRIOR_MAX_POSITIVE_OFFSET_MHZ = 250` (default `+30` untouched). Fail-closed: an
  offset above the cap is REFUSED, never clamped; the stock clock ceiling still caps the effective clock.
- **Gates**: `--manual-prior` requires `--start-mv`; confirmed requires `--steps 1` (delegates to
  `confirmed_f2_refusal`); confirmed reuses `run_confirmed_f2_step`/`RealF2Ops` with `manual_limits`; one
  candidate; no persist/apply/promote. F1/`apply_vf_ceiling_monotone`/Safe Loop/reset/verifier untouched.
- **Dry-run `1800 @ 875`**: selected **875 mV**, base **1590 MHz**, required **+210 MHz**, cap **+250**,
  within bounds, **AnchoredRaiseVerified**, no-op/no-write. Default `1800 --steps 3` unchanged (975/968/962).
- **Tests/review**: 269 service + 33 nvapi tests pass; manual safety review no blockers. Implementation
  commit `34581d0`.
- **HARDWARE PASS (one confirmed run, operator present)**: `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --start-mv
  875 --steps 1 --manual-prior --confirm` → exit 0, outcome **Validated**. Anchor 875 mV / base 1590 /
  **+210 → 1800**; verify **AnchoredRaiseVerified**; dwell **Stable** avg/p5 **1815 MHz** at **157 W** (~26 W
  under the 975 mV/183 W run); `reset_to_stock` OK (all bins cleared); boot flag cleared; not blacklisted;
  **no persist/apply/promote** (`last_validated` null). No TDR/crash/reboot. `safe_loop.json` byte-identical
  (mtime-only); `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent.
- **NEXT**: clocks above 1800 at 875 mV are NOT assumed (discover progressively). Options: descend below
  875 mV for 1800 (minimum stable voltage), or progressive discovery for 1815+. No second confirmed run was
  made.

## Earlier checkpoint (2026-06-21) — F2 ANCHORED MULTI-STEP descent IMPLEMENTED (not yet HW-validated)
- **What**: bounded SAME-TARGET ANCHORED multi-step descent for `undervolt-probe`. `--steps 2..=3` (anchored)
  executes a short sequence of anchored candidates at ONE target, safer/higher voltage → lower voltage,
  STOPPING at the first non-stable candidate and keeping the last good point. **Code + tests + docs only —
  no hardware, no `--confirm`, no VF write, no Safe Loop mutation outside tests.**
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (planner + orchestrator + trait + refusal + formatters +
  RealF2MultiOps + 12 tests), `crates/service/src/main.rs` (doc comment only).
- **Step cap**: `F2_CONFIRMED_MAX_STEPS = 3`, enforced by `confirmed_f2_multi_refusal` (`--steps` 1..=3 else
  FAIL CLOSED). `--steps 1` = the validated single-step path (untouched). `--simple` = single-step only.
- **How it works**: `plan_anchored_undervolt_descent` (anchored analog of `plan_undervolt_probe`; chains the
  +15 per-step cap, stops at first rejection) → `run_confirmed_f2_multi_step` drives the SAME validated
  `run_confirmed_f2_step` motor per candidate via the `F2MultiStepOps` candidate-cursor trait. `select(i)`
  re-checks Safe Loop + blacklist before each write. Continues only on a stable `Validated` candidate
  (dwell stable + reset confirmed + flag cleared); stops on `VerifierFailed`/`Unstable`/`DeviceLost`/
  `ClockDrop`/`ResetFailed`/`Blacklisted`. New `F2DwellOutcome::ClockDrop` (p5 < target − 30 MHz on an
  otherwise-stable dwell) stops the descent; additive — single-step Stable/Unstable/DeviceLost unchanged.
- **Validated (no hardware)**: 256 service tests + 33 nvapi tests pass (incl. F1/build-frontier + single-step).
  Dry-run `--target-mhz 1800 --steps 3` → 3 candidates (975 mV +15 → 968 mV +30 → 962 mV +30, stop=budget),
  preflight OK, no-op line; `--help`/`--steps 1` unchanged; `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent.
- **NEXT (hardware, one confirmed run, operator present, stop after first non-stable)**:
  `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 3 --confirm`. No persist/apply/promote. NOT yet HW-validated.

## Earlier checkpoint (2026-06-21) — F2 ANCHORED undervolt FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION — PASS
- **One supervised confirmed run** (operator present, ONE confirmed command, no second) validating the `747a11b`
  anchored branch on real hardware: `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 1 --confirm`. **First real ANCHORED
  positive-offset VF write.** HEAD = origin/master = `747a11b`, tree clean. **Fresh worktree binary built first**
  (`cargo build -p nidavellir-service`) — `target/debug/nidavellir-service.exe` was ABSENT; built mtime newer than
  `747a11b`.
- **Preflight PASS**: tree clean; `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; `safe_mode=false`;
  `boot_flag_armed=false`; `consecutive_crashes=1`; planned anchored point NOT blacklisted. Help = usage only;
  dry-run = mode **ANCHORED**, exactly ONE candidate + no-op line (no arm/apply/dwell/VF write).
- **Result: exit 0, outcome `Validated`.** No TDR / black-screen / reboot / DeviceLost / Unstable / silent error.
- **Anchored candidate (live curve)**: target **1800 MHz**, anchor bin **975 mV**, base **1785 MHz**, offset
  **+15 MHz** → 1800; **27** higher-voltage bins capped DOWN to 1800 (max flatten **-150 MHz**), **59** lower bins
  elastic. Within +15 step / +30 abs caps. (Earlier dry-run had read 981 mV / 25 / -135 / 61; the live curve at
  confirm time put the +15 anchor at 975 mV — 981 mV was already at base 1800 → capped +0.)
- **Sequence (motor end-to-end)**: Safe Loop armed BEFORE write → `apply_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` applied →
  `verify_anchored_positive_offset` = **`AnchoredRaiseVerified`** → dwell **Stable** (avg **1815 MHz**, p5 **1815 MHz**,
  **183 W**, no silent error) → `reset_to_stock` ran + CONFIRMED stock (all written bins cleared) → boot flag cleared
  after clean reset. Not blacklisted. **No profile persisted/applied/promoted** (Validated reported only).
- **Post-run**: `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent; `safe_loop.json` **byte-identical** (sha256 unchanged,
  mtime touched only); `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/`heartbeat.txt` unchanged; tree clean; HEAD `747a11b`.
- **Boost constrained vs prior SIMPLE F2**: simple run boosted elastically above target (avg **1868**, p5 **1845**,
  **199 W**); anchored run pins a flat plateau (avg **1815** = p5 **1815**, **183 W**, ~**16 W** lower). avg==p5
  confirms the plateau caps prevent boost above 1800; the +15 over target is within the 15 MHz verifier tolerance.
- **Meaning**: the F2 ANCHORED-undervolt HARDWARE path is PROVEN at one bounded point — the classic `MHz @ mV`
  undervolt SHAPE (anchor raise + plateau cap + elastic lower bins) holds on real hardware and the
  **arm → write → verify → dwell → reset → clear** motor is recoverable. First result that directly supports the
  intended method (map stable voltage per clock → repeat across clocks → synthesize Godforge / Brokkr's Best /
  Deep Calm). Does NOT yet prove the MINIMUM stable voltage for 1800 MHz.
- **Next (do NOT immediately run another confirmed command before this record is committed)**: a bounded, supervised,
  same-target **MULTI-STEP** anchored probe at 1800 MHz descending voltage until verifier fail / instability / clock
  drop / floor / budget, with the same Safe Loop / verification / reset guarantees. Detail in `decisions.md` (top).

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-21) — F2 ANCHORED undervolt planning IMPLEMENTED (no hardware)
- **What**: F2 moves from a single positive offset at one VF bin to a true CLASSIC anchored undervolt
  point. The planner now RAISES the anchor bin to target AND CAPS every higher-voltage bin DOWN to the
  same target (≤ 0 offsets), leaving lower bins elastic. **ANCHORED is the DEFAULT** mode; `--simple`
  keeps the old single-bin descent. Code + tests + docs only — **no `--confirm`, no VF write, no Safe
  Loop mutation, no build-frontier, no stress, no power sweep.**
- **Why**: the prior confirmed F2 run (below) proved the positive-offset MOTOR but was NOT anchored — the
  GPU still boosted ABOVE the 1800 MHz target (dwell avg 1868). Classic `MHz @ mV` undervolt must test an
  anchored curve point, not one raised bin with the boost curve still free above it.
- **New symbols** (all SEPARATE from F1/build-frontier; `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone` UNTOUCHED):
  `plan_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` / `apply_bounded_anchored_positive_offset` /
  `AnchoredPositiveOffsetPlan` (gpu-nvapi, the anchor reuses the bounded single-bin planner →inherits all
  caps/floor/ceiling rules); `verify_anchored_positive_offset` / `AnchoredOffsetVerification` (gpu_verify);
  `UndervoltMode` / `plan_anchored_undervolt` / `select_anchor_bin` / `anchored_plan_lines` /
  `run_anchored_undervolt_probe` (gpu_undervolt). `RealF2Ops` gained `mode` + `anchored` (writes the full
  curve, verifies with the anchored verifier, confirms ALL written bins read ~0 on reset).
- **Confirmed branch (anchored, NOT executed)**: ONE anchored curve plan, single-step (`--steps 1`), arms
  Safe Loop before write, resets on every post-arm exit, clears boot flag only after a confirmed reset, no
  persistence/apply/promotion. `confirmed_f2_refusal` reuses the anchor as the candidate.
- **Validation**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean; `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **240
  passed**; `cargo test -p nidavellir-gpu-nvapi` **33 passed**. F1/build-frontier + simple-F2 tests still
  green. **Read-only dry-run** (`undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 1`, NO `--confirm`): anchor
  **981 mV base 1785 +15 → 1800** (same point as the prior confirmed run), **25** higher-voltage bins
  capped DOWN to 1800 (max flatten **-135 MHz**), 2 already at target, **61** lower bins elastic; `plan
  self-check = AnchoredRaiseVerified`; no-op (no arm/apply/dwell/VF write). `--help` and `--simple` both
  verified. No Safe Loop / forge state mutated (only the 3 source files changed).
- **Hardware NOT yet validated for anchored mode.** First future anchored validation should be:
  `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 1 --confirm` — ONE candidate, operator present, NOT
  multi-step, no second confirmed run. Detail in `decisions.md` (top).

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-21) — F2 true-undervolt FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION — PASS
- **One supervised confirmed run** (operator present, ONE confirmed command, no second) validating the `78ecfc7`
  F2 confirmed branch on real hardware: `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 1 --confirm`. **First real
  positive-offset VF write.** HEAD = origin/master = `78ecfc7`, tree clean. **Fresh worktree binary built first**
  (`cargo build -p nidavellir-service`) — `target/debug/nidavellir-service.exe` was ABSENT; built mtime newer
  than `78ecfc7`.
- **Preflight PASS**: tree clean; `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; `safe_mode=false`;
  `boot_flag_armed=false`; `consecutive_crashes=1`; planned point NOT blacklisted (`blacklisted_points=0`). Help =
  usage only; dry-run = exactly ONE candidate + no-op line (no arm/apply/dwell/VF write).
- **Result: exit 0, outcome `Validated`.** No TDR / black-screen / reboot / DeviceLost / Unstable / silent error.
- **Candidate**: target **1800 MHz**, bin **981 mV**, base **1785 MHz**, offset **+15 MHz** (within +15 step /
  +30 abs caps).
- **Sequence (motor end-to-end)**: Safe Loop armed BEFORE write → `apply_bounded_positive_offset` applied →
  `verify_positive_offset` = **`RaiseVerified`** → dwell **Stable** (avg **1868 MHz**, p5 **1845 MHz**, **199 W**,
  no silent error) → `reset_to_stock` ran + CONFIRMED stock (offset cleared) → boot flag cleared after clean reset.
  Not blacklisted. **No profile persisted/applied/promoted** (Validated reported only, never written to
  `last_validated`).
- **Post-run**: `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent; `safe_loop.json` **byte-identical** (sha256 unchanged,
  mtime touched only — `safe_mode=false`, `consecutive_crashes=1`, blacklist 4 entries, `last_validated=null`);
  `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/`heartbeat.txt` unchanged; tree clean; HEAD `78ecfc7`.
- **Meaning**: the F2 true-undervolt HARDWARE path is PROVEN at one bounded positive-offset point — the
  **arm → write → verify → dwell → reset → clear** motor is viable and recoverable on real hardware. It does NOT
  prove an optimal undervolt profile (minimum-viable path only). The dwell clock above 1800 MHz (1868 avg) is
  EXPECTED — this probe does not lock the clock; the GPU still boosts per curve/power; `RaiseVerified` confirms
  the +15 raise on the 981 mV bin.
- **Next (do NOT immediately run another confirmed command)**: one of — (1) bounded/supervised F2 MULTI-STEP probe
  for the same target; (2) explicit `--start-mv` confirmed single-step if not yet supported; (3) result recording /
  Forge Knowledge for validated F2 candidates without promotion. First optimization = search the lower-voltage
  limit around 1800 MHz with the same Safe Loop / verification / reset guarantees. Detail in `decisions.md` (top).

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-20) — F2 CONFIRMED single-step branch IMPLEMENTED, not executed (no hardware)
- **What**: the first real confirmed F2 hardware branch (`undervolt-probe --confirm`). Single-target,
  single-step only. IMPLEMENTED but NOT executed — no `--confirm` run, no VF write, no Safe Loop mutation.
- **Confirmed state machine** (`gpu_undervolt.rs`, trait-isolated + mock-tested): `run_confirmed_f2_step`
  over `F2Ops` = arm boot flag → apply ONE bounded positive offset (`apply_bounded_positive_offset`) →
  verify (offset-presence; idle freq=None) → dwell once → `reset_to_stock` on EVERY exit → clear flag ONLY
  after a CONFIRMED reset. Outcomes: ArmFailed/ApplyFailed/VerifyFailed/Unstable/DeviceLost/ResetFailed/
  Validated.
- **Boot-flag / reset policy** (unit-tested): real `reset_to_stock` re-reads the bin offset and returns Ok
  ONLY if it confirms ~0 (unreadable/non-zero → fail closed → flag RETAINED — F2 never leaves a curve
  applied). Flag cleared only on confirmed reset; RETAINED on DeviceLost + on reset failure. DeviceLost/
  Unstable blacklist the point; only Stable+confirmed-reset → Validated (reported only, never written to
  `last_validated`). No persist/apply/promotion.
- **Preflight** (`confirmed_f2_refusal`, pure): refuses unless --steps 1; not Safe Mode; no armed flag;
  consecutive_crashes < 3 (`SAFE_MODE_CRASH_THRESHOLD`); candidate exists + within bounds; not blacklisted
  (3-axis F2 intent OR 2-axis freq/vf_bin). `run_undervolt_probe_cmd` runs startup recovery on --confirm.
- **Help fixed**: `--help`/`-h` short-circuits before any hardware/plan/Safe-Loop access; prints usage +
  --confirm WARNING (may write VF; operator required).
- **F1 untouched**: `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone` + build-frontier unchanged; `gpu_power_sweep.rs` edits are
  additive/visibility only (`reset_to_stock` pub(crate); new `single_load_dwell`/`SingleDwell` reusing
  `load_and_measure`). No power-limit/TDP/clock-lock. Dry-run output unchanged except footer + help.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (confirmed branch + tests), `gpu_power_sweep.rs`
  (adapters), `main.rs` (help + confirm dispatch), `gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs` UNCHANGED this task.
- **Validation (no hardware)**: `cargo check` clean; `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **228/0** (+15);
  `cargo test -p nidavellir-gpu-nvapi` **25/0**; dry-run + `--help` exercised read-only.
- **First future run** (operator present, ONE run only): `undervolt-probe --target-mhz 1800 --steps 1 --confirm`.
- **Hardware: STILL BLOCKED / not validated.** Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-20) — F2 true-undervolt foundation IMPLEMENTED (pure, no hardware)
- **What**: the first isolated F2 (true-undervolt) foundation. F2 needs BOUNDED POSITIVE VF offsets (raise a
  lower-voltage bin to hold the target clock) — the OPPOSITE of F1/build-frontier's flatten-down. F1's
  `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone` refuses positive offsets and its verifier treats clock-above-target as failure,
  so F2 is a SEPARATE path with its own bounded, fail-closed symbols. F1/build-frontier is UNCHANGED.
- **Files**:
  - `crates/gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs`: pure `plan_bounded_positive_offset` + windows `apply_bounded_positive_offset`;
    `PositiveOffsetPlan` / `PositiveOffsetLimits`; consts `POS_OFFSET_MAX_MHZ=+30`, `POS_OFFSET_STEP_MAX_MHZ=+15`.
  - `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`: pure `verify_positive_offset` → `PositiveOffsetVerification`
    (RaiseVerified / RaiseIncomplete / OverRaise / Unverifiable). Flatten-down verifier untouched.
  - `crates/service/src/gpu_undervolt.rs` (NEW): pure `plan_undervolt_probe` search skeleton + pure
    `undervolt_preflight` (Safe Loop read-only refusal) + windows `run_undervolt_probe` (dry-run; `--confirm`
    fails closed).
  - `crates/service/src/main.rs`: `undervolt-probe` subcommand + `parse_undervolt_args` (dry-run default;
    `--confirm` parsed but REFUSED this task). `mod gpu_undervolt;` registered.
- **Fail-closed planner rules**: empty/foreign/non-sane base → Err; non-real bin → Err; below hardware floor →
  Err; offset ≤ 0 (positive-only) → Err; offset > +30 abs cap → Err; per-step delta > +15 → Err; planned clock
  > conservative ceiling → Err. NEVER silently clamps; bounds are CONSTANTS (not CLI-widenable); returns the
  plan BEFORE any write.
- **Scope (v1)**: one focus target, small bounded offset, NO persist/apply/promote, NO multi-target loop, NO
  autonomous crash-seeking. Confirmed mode (future) stops on first crash/TDR/instability/verifier-fail.
- **NOT touched**: `apply_vf_ceiling_monotone`, F1 flatten-down writer/verifier, Safe Loop, boot flag,
  `reset_to_stock`, blacklist, last-known-good, power-limit/TDP/clock-lock. Dry-run reads Safe Loop READ-ONLY.
- **Confirmed path NOT implemented** (explicit TODOs in `gpu_undervolt.rs`): arm boot flag before a positive
  write; clear only after clean dwell+reset; crash leaves recovery/blacklist state; last-known-good fallback.
- **Validation (no hardware)**: see the implementation commit for `cargo check` / `cargo test` results.
- **Hardware: BLOCKED.** No `--confirm`, no VF write, no apply/persist, no Safe Loop mutation. Next: dry-run
  review of `undervolt-probe`, THEN (after review) a first supervised one-step confirmed F2 validation. Detail
  in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-20) — F1c bounded-tail confirmed PASS + tail-richness follow-up
- **Confirmed run (2026-06-20) of the bounded tail (`8667bf0`) = PASS.** Safety/mechanics clean (exit 0, no
  TDR/crash/reboot, reset_to_stock ran, no persist/apply, state byte-identical, monotone writer
  positive_offsets=0). Phase A collapsed; Phase B focus 1800, started 1056 mV (below 1062 floor, skipped
  1075/1068/1062), crossed the knee (pcf 1.000@1012 → **0.215@1006 mV**), **continued past the first off-cap
  point to 1000 mV, captured 2 useful points**, stopped `KneeTailComplete`; **synthesis became `differentiated`**.
- **Remaining issue**: both tail points (1006 & 1000 mV) were ~199 W → Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm all
  coincided at ~1811 MHz @ 1006 mV / 199 W. Differentiated (not collapse) but THIN.
- **This follow-up**: enrich the tail — `PHASE_B_MIN_USEFUL_POINTS` 2→**4**, `PHASE_B_POST_KNEE_TAIL_BINS`
  3→**5** (the synthesis collapse threshold `MIN_USEFUL_FRONTIER_POINTS` STAYS 2). Phase B now keeps a bounded
  tail until 4 useful off-cap points OR 5 post-knee bins. Opt-in / default OFF; no new CLI flag;
  `--phase-b-probes` + global `--max-probes` still bound it; failure/verifier/instability/floor/budget keep
  precedence.
- **Unchanged**: Phase A, synthesis, bind-seeking, full safety chain (writer/verifier/Safe Loop/reset_to_stock/
  floor/cluster/persistence/power-limit/clock-lock). File: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` only.
- **Hardware**: one confirmed validation authorized for this follow-up (same flags) to see if power drops below
  the knee and the three profiles separate. Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-16) — F1c follow-up: Phase B captures a bounded below-knee TAIL (commit 8667bf0) — pure, no hardware
- **Why**: the FIRST confirmed knee-seeking run (2026-06-16, PASS-PARTIAL) found the real knee at **~1025 mV**
  (Phase B started 1056 mV below the 1062 Phase-A floor, descended to 1025 where **pcf dropped 1.000→0.437 in
  one 6 mV bin** — a steep knee). But Phase B stopped at that FIRST off-cap point → only **1** useful point →
  synthesis correctly still reported `POWER-BOUND COLLAPSE`. Stop policy, not budget, was the limiter.
- **What landed**: `descend_phase_b` now captures a BOUNDED below-knee tail. After the knee crossing (first
  `pcf < POWER_BOUND_FRAC` point) it keeps descending until `PHASE_B_MIN_USEFUL_POINTS` (=2) useful off-cap
  points OR `PHASE_B_POST_KNEE_TAIL_BINS` (=3) post-knee bins, then stops cleanly as new
  `BracketStop::KneeTailComplete`. ≥ 2 useful → existing synthesis differentiates; 1 → honest collapse.
- **Safety precedence preserved**: crash / abort / global drain / verifier failure / instability are checked
  BEFORE the tail and stop immediately; floor / `--phase-b-probes` / global `--max-probes` still bound it.
- **Confirmed-run safety (PASS)**: exit 0, no TDR/crash/reboot, `reset_to_stock` ran, no persist/apply
  (`gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; state files byte-identical), monotone writer `positive_offsets=0`.
- **Unchanged**: Phase A, synthesis, bind-seeking, safety chain (writer/verifier/Safe Loop/reset_to_stock/
  floor/cluster/persistence/power-limit/clock-lock); opt-in / default OFF; no new CLI flag.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` only (BracketStop variant + 2 consts + `descend_phase_b`
  tail loop + dry-run plan line + tests).
- **Validation**: `cargo check` clean (0 warnings); `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **203 / 0** (8 new).
- **Hardware STILL BLOCKED**. Next: NEW dry-run-only review of the bounded-tail plan output, before any
  further confirmed run. Non-goals unchanged. Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-16) — F1c follow-up: Phase B continues BELOW Phase-A floor (commit 9f35ec0) — pure, no hardware
- **What landed**: a budget-efficiency fix for F1c Phase B, acting on the dry-run-only review finding.
  Phase B now CONTINUES below the deepest bin Phase A already explored for the focused target instead of
  re-probing the inert top bins. Files: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` only (no `main.rs` / no new
  flag). Pure: no hardware, no `--confirm`.
- **Why**: on this card's fine VF curve (~6–7 mV/bin), the `0ef4e68` Phase B re-started from the cap, so
  `--phase-b-probes 12` reached only ~1006 mV — re-covering Phase A's 1075/1068/1062 and stopping ~75 mV
  above the ~930 mV knee. Now each Phase-B probe lands on a new, deeper bin.
- **How**: two pure helpers in the orchestrator — `phase_a_deepest_bin` (focus target's deepest retained
  Phase-A bin) + `phase_b_start_below` (highest real bin strictly below it). Fallbacks: no Phase-A history
  for the target → safe-start cap; Phase A already at the floor → Phase B skipped cleanly. Dry-run plan adds
  a `knee start` line.
- **Unchanged**: Phase A, `descend_phase_b`, synthesis, safety chain (writer/verifier/Safe Loop/
  `reset_to_stock`/floor/cluster/persistence/power-limit/clock-lock); opt-in / default OFF; global
  `--max-probes` master cap.
- **Validation**: `cargo check` clean (0 warnings); `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **195 passed / 0
  failed** (5 new). No hardware.
- **Hardware STILL BLOCKED**. Next: a NEW dry-run-only review confirming the improved plan (`knee start`
  line, deeper reach). Budget sizing remains the operator's call (~20+ Phase-B probes to cross a ~930 mV
  knee from a ~1062 mV Phase-A floor); this patch makes each probe count, default budget unchanged (12).
  Non-goals unchanged. Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — F1c power-bound knee-seeking two-phase prototype IMPLEMENTED (commit 0ef4e68) — pure, no hardware
- **What landed**: an OPT-IN (default OFF) two-phase knee-seeking mode for `build-frontier`, the
  design-audit direction `NEED DEEPER POWER-BOUND DESCENT`. Phase A = the existing single-pass descent
  (byte-for-byte unchanged when OFF; extracted into `run_target_descents`). Phase B (only after a Phase-A
  power-bound collapse) detects the plateau (median power-bound clock), picks the lowest candidate target
  ≥ plateau, and descends THAT target deeper to cross the knee, then merges + re-synthesizes via the
  existing `synthesize_forge_profiles`. New CLI flags `--power-bound-knee-seeking` + `--phase-b-probes N`
  (default None → 12). Global `--max-probes` stays the master cap.
- **Why**: the validated `0996769` collapse only walked the top ~13 mV (bins `1075/1068/1062`), ~130 mV
  above the card's operating voltage, so the VF ceiling was inert and pcf stayed 1.000 — an honest
  diagnostic for a SHALLOW descent, not proof no frontier exists. Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).
- **Knee model**: above the knee `pcf >= 0.95` (ceiling inert — keep descending); knee = first pcf drop
  below 0.95; clean deep stop at `pcf <= 0.50`; below-knee tail feeds Brokkr's / Deep Calm; Godforge =
  highest sustained off-cap clock (the knee region), NOT the highest requested clock. No knee ⇒ the honest
  `PowerBoundCollapse` is preserved.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` (helpers + `descend_phase_b` +
  `build_frontier_two_phase` + `FrontierLimits` fields + `validate_limits` + dry-run plan lines + wiring +
  tests); `crates/service/src/main.rs` (2 CLI flags + parse test).
- **Safety surfaces UNCHANGED** (diff audited): monotone writer, verifier gates, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`
  (runs after every build, both paths), floor/cluster derivation, per-target cap, warm-start default OFF,
  persistence/knowledge writes, power-limit / TDP / clock-lock.
- **Validation**: `cargo check` clean (0 warnings); `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **190 passed / 0
  failed** (17 new). No dry-run / `--confirm` / hardware.
- **Hardware STILL BLOCKED**. Next: a SEPARATE dry-run-only review of the Phase-B plan output (no
  `--confirm`). A later confirmed run must be a bounded knee-seeking shape (one focused target descended
  deep past ~930 mV), NOT a same-config rerun. Non-goals unchanged: no power-limit/TDP, no clock-lock, no
  persistence/apply, no safety-chain change.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — F1b power-bound collapse classification FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION (commit 0996769) — PASS
- **One supervised confirmed run** (operator present) validating `0996769`; HEAD = `origin/master` = `4880153`,
  tree clean; fresh worktree-local binary (built after `0996769`, not the stale main-repo target). Confirming
  dry-run gate passed first. Command: `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21
  --max-probes-per-target 3 --safe-start-cap 1075 --bind-seeking`. **Exit 0; ~5.7 min.**
- **Safety PASS**: no TDR / crash / driver reset / black-screen / reboot; `reset_to_stock` ran; GPU back at
  stock/idle. After: `gpu_applied.json` / `boot_flag.json` absent; `safe_loop.json` idle/disarmed
  (`safe_mode:false`, no new crash/blacklist entry, mtime touched by startup recovery only); `forge_state.json`
  / `gpu_knowledge.json` / `heartbeat.txt` byte-unchanged; tree clean. Every probe `write_mode=monotone_static`,
  `positive_offsets=0`; no overshoot veto.
- **Mechanics**: 19 probes / 17 dwells; `--max-probes 21` not exhausted; **6 of 7 targets characterized**. 1920
  dropped on a benign verifier `LiveMismatch` at the start bin (verifier worked, no crash, run-variance); 1890
  hit a later `LiveMismatch`, kept its deepest verified bin. Descended to 1062/1068 mV. All dwells PowerLimited,
  `power_capped_frac=1.000`, ~199 W, ~1784–1825 MHz.
- **Reporting honesty PASS**: no `BoundBinding`, no `reason=Clock`. **Clock arm retirement validated** — probes
  with avg clock within 30 MHz of target (which would FALSE-bind under v2) correctly did NOT bind, descended to
  `PerTargetCap`. **`LeftPowerRegime` validated negatively** — evaluated each eligible probe, `bound=false
  reason=None`, no target stopped by it (none had pcf ≤ 0.50). **`PowerBound`/`PowerBoundCollapse` validated
  positively** — 6 points `[power-bound]`; reported `6 power-bound / 0 useful`; explicit *"power-bound collapse
  — cannot build a differentiated VF frontier under this workload/regime"*; frontier classes = `POWER-BOUND
  COLLAPSE (best-effort, NOT a differentiated VF frontier)`. Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm collapsed to one
  best-effort point (1815 MHz / 199 W, R=0.00), confidence 0.21, all flagged not-differentiated — no fake
  frontier.
- **Verdict PASS** (safety + reporting honesty). Physical frontier still not useful here: the card is pinned at
  the ~199 W cap, now reported honestly. **Caveats**: `LeftPowerRegime` validated negatively only (a positive
  stop needs pcf ≤ 0.50, which this regime never produces); 1920 LiveMismatch is benign run-variance.
- **Direction**: accept the patch; **keep hardware BLOCKED for this same config**; do NOT repeat the run, do NOT
  bump the per-target cap, do NOT tune power-limit/TDP/clock-lock yet. Next is a design decision: a workload that
  doesn't saturate the ~199 W cap, candidate targets below the power-bound plateau, or a design pass for
  presenting "cannot differentiate under this workload/regime." Detail in `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — F1b power-bound collapse classification IMPLEMENTED (commit 0996769) — pure, no hardware
- **Commit `0996769 fix(service): classify power-bound frontier collapse`** (pushed to `origin/master` with
  the docs entry). Scope: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` ONLY. Implements the SIMPLIFY patch from the
  audit below. No hardware, no `--confirm`, no dry-run.
- **Retired bind-seeking's Clock arm** — `classify_binding` is regime-only: a target binds (stops early) ONLY
  when it LEFT the power-limited regime (`power_capped_frac <= 0.50`). Removed `BIND_OVERSHOOT_MHZ`,
  `BindThresholds.overshoot_mhz`, `BindReason::Clock`; start-bin eligibility guard kept. Renamed
  `BracketStop::BoundBinding → LeftPowerRegime`.
- **Power-bound classification** (`POWER_BOUND_FRAC = 0.95`): pure `is_power_bound_frac` / `is_power_bound_point`
  / `useful_frontier_points` / `frontier_power_bound_collapse`. A pcf-saturated stable dwell = VALID raw
  bracket, NOT useful clock-frontier diversity. Invalid/missing pcf → not power-bound (fail open for
  classification), still fail-CLOSED for regime binding.
- **Collapse-aware synthesis**: `synthesize_forge_profiles` excludes power-bound points; < 2 useful → FLAGGED
  best-effort + diagnostic *"power-bound collapse — cannot build a differentiated VF frontier under this
  workload/regime"* (new `ForgeProfiles.power_bound_excluded` / `power_bound_collapse`). Catches the jittery
  ~1798–1819 MHz @ pcf 1.0 plateau the exact-distinct-clock check missed. NO power-bound points → legacy path
  byte-for-byte unchanged. RESULT output now prints per-point `pcf` + a `frontier classes` summary.
- **Safety surfaces UNCHANGED** (diff audited — no protected symbol added/removed): monotone writer, verifier
  gates, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`, floor/cluster derivation, per-target cap, warm-start default OFF,
  persistence/knowledge writes, power-limit/clock-lock.
- **Validation (no hardware)**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean; `cargo test -p nidavellir-service`
  **173 passed / 0 failed** (was 169: +5 power-bound tests, +2 regime tests, −3 retired clock tests).
- **Hardware STILL BLOCKED**: pure code/test patch. Next confirmed run only AFTER reviewing the new
  classification/reporting in a fresh dry-run; the same-config rerun remains not recommended. Full detail in
  `decisions.md` (top entry).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — build-frontier / F1b algorithm audit — verdict SIMPLIFY (read-only, pre-implementation)
- **Read-only audit only.** Inspected `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` + continuity docs. **No code edit,
  no tests, no `build-frontier`, no `--confirm`, no hardware, no VF write, no stress, no power sweep** were run.
  This entry records the audit conclusion BEFORE implementation so the next patch has a clear north star.
- **Verdict: SIMPLIFY CURRENT DIRECTION.** Not a redesign, not a full rollback. Do **not** run more hardware
  before the next pure/pure-ish patch; do **not** keep adding bind-seeking complexity. The discovery → descent
  → synthesis skeleton is still valid; the drift is concentrated in **bind-seeking / `BoundBinding`** semantics.
- **North star (unchanged)**: 1) find max core clock / top sustainable target; 2) start at max safe voltage /
  safe VF ceiling; 3) dwell holding the target; 4) descend real VF voltage bins while sustainable; 5) stop each
  target on an explicit reason — unstable, verifier failure, crash/abort/budget drain, voltage floor, per-target
  cap, **or power-bound regime/collapse**; 6) next lower target; 7) build a real stable frontier; 8) synthesize
  Godforge / Brokkr's / Deep Calm **only from meaningful (non-power-bound) data**.
- **Load-bearing — KEEP**: hardware-derived floor; cluster selection / sane-core VF filtering; real-bin descent;
  per-target probe cap; the typed hard/soft stops; confidence gate + best-effort fallback; monotone static-base
  writer; verifier gates; Safe Loop; `reset_to_stock`; no profile persistence during build-frontier.
- **Bind-seeking conclusion**: `BoundBinding` is the wrong **combined** abstraction — it mixes a **bad Clock
  arm** (false-binds under power cap: the cap, not the descent, sets the clock) with a **useful Regime arm**
  (`power_capped_frac <= 0.5`, card left power-limited behavior). The v2 start-bin guard was useful + validated
  but did NOT solve physical frontier collapse. The confirmed v2 run (`bf02971`) stayed power-limited
  throughout: `power_capped_frac=1.000`, ~199 W, ~1798–1819 MHz, confidence 0.21, profiles collapsed. ⇒ the
  remaining issue is **regime / power-bound collapse, not scheduler depth or per-target probe count**.
- **Decision**: stop treating a `Clock` bind as sufficient evidence of useful VF-bound behavior when
  `power_capped_frac` is saturated; **retire/neutralize the Clock arm**; keep the regime signal reclassified as
  **`LeftPowerRegime`**; add a first-class **`PowerBound` / `PowerLimitedPlateau` / `PowerBoundCollapse`**
  classification; strengthen synthesis so power-bound samples are valid raw brackets but **not** useful
  clock-frontier diversity. NOTE: the current collapse detector keys on exact-distinct clocks, so a jittery
  ~1798–1819 MHz plateau reads as ~6 "distinct" clocks and the warning never fires — even with bind-seeking OFF
  synthesis silently emits a falsely-differentiated frontier. Re-key it on pcf saturation.
- **Power-limited sample treatment**: valid bracket = yes; useful clock-frontier point = no (when pcf
  saturated); synthesis = raw input yes but excluded from differentiated selection; collapse diagnostic = yes
  (primary). Mark, don't discard (still a valid warm-start seed).
- **Next safest patch (pure / mostly pure, `gpu_power_sweep.rs`)**: add/rename stop classifications
  (`VoltageFloor`, `DepthCap`, `LeftPowerRegime`, `Unstable`, `VerifyFailed`, `Crashed`, `Aborted`,
  `BudgetDrained`, `PowerBound`/`PowerBoundCollapse`); strengthen `synthesize_forge_profiles` (detect the
  pcf-saturated plateau; don't treat jittery ~1800 MHz clocks as a real differentiated frontier; emit
  *"power-bound collapse — cannot build a differentiated VF frontier under this workload/regime"*); add tests
  over synthetic samples; **do not touch the hardware-writing path.** Optionally add read-only power-headroom
  telemetry.
- **Explicit non-goals**: no confirmed hardware run; no power-limit/TDP changes; no clock-lock changes; no
  target-generation redesign yet; no warm-start default change; no per-target cap change; no Safe Loop / reset /
  writer / verifier changes; no profile persistence / knowledge write change; no version bump.
- **Hardware: BLOCKED** until the power-bound classification + collapse report land and a fresh dry-run shows
  the new diagnostics. Re-running the proven-uninformative config is not justified. Full audit rationale in
  `decisions.md` (top entry); index line in `memory.md`.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — bind-seeking F1b v2 strictness FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION — mechanism PASS / frontier PARTIAL (commit bf02971)
- **Supervised confirmed run** (operator present; this session). Validates `bf02971 fix(service): tighten
  bind-seeking stop criteria`; docs already at `3b8774c docs: record bind-seeking v2 strictness`
  (HEAD = origin/master = `3b8774c`, working tree clean).
- **Fresh worktree binary built first.** The worktree-local `target/debug/nidavellir-service.exe` was ABSENT
  and the only existing binary was STALE (main-repo `target/debug`, built 2026-06-07 — predates the entire
  bind-seeking feature). Built `cargo build -p nidavellir-service` → worktree binary created AFTER the build
  (mtime after the build marker, size differs from stale); the **stale main-repo binary was NOT used**;
  working tree stayed clean (target/ is gitignored).
- **Dry-run gate passed** (no `--confirm`): bind-seeking ENABLED; v2 strict "start bin is NOT bind-eligible"
  note; thresholds `avg_clock_overshoot <= 30 MHz` + `power_capped_frac <= 0.50`; coverage-bounded scheduler;
  `max_probes=Some(21)`; `max_probes_per_target=Some(3)`; targets `[1935,1905,1875,1845,1815,1785,1755]`;
  first-pass bins `[1075,1068,1062]`; warm-start OFF; no applied-profile warning; no Safe Loop conflict
  warning; dry-run no-op line (no Safe Loop arm / apply / dwell / VF write).
- **Confirmed command**: `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21 --max-probes-per-target 3
  --safe-start-cap 1075 --bind-seeking`.
- **Safety: PASS.** Exit 0; **no TDR / driver reset / black-screen / reboot / crash**. Startup recovery clean
  ("clean boot, nothing to restore"); `reset_to_stock` ran ("GPU restored to stock; no profile applied or
  persisted"). After: `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` **absent**; `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/
  `heartbeat.txt` **unchanged** (no persistence, no knowledge write); `safe_loop.json` stayed **idle**
  (`safe_mode:false`), size unchanged — only mtime bumped by startup recovery, no new blacklist/crash entry.
  GPU back at stock idle.
- **Probe result**: **15 probes/dwells** total; **all 7 targets physically characterized**. 6 stopped via
  **`BoundBinding`** (1935, 1905, 1875, 1845, 1815, 1785, each `probes_used=2`); 1 stopped via
  **`PerTargetCap`** (1755, `probes_used=3`). No target dropped. Global `--max-probes 21` **not exhausted**
  (15/21). No `overshoot_veto`. Every probe `write_mode=monotone_static`, `positive_offsets=0`.
- **v2 mechanism — PASS (start-bin guard validated).** **Every** 1075 mV start bin reported
  `eligible=false / bound=false` — v2 definitively prevents start-bin binding. All 7 targets descended to
  **1068 mV**; **1755** descended further to **1062 mV**. Earliest binding occurred only AFTER a real bin
  descent (the 6 bound targets bound at the 2nd bin, 1068, `reason=Clock`). Bind telemetry present on every
  probe: `eligible / bound / reason / avg_clock_mhz / p5_clock_mhz / power_capped_frac`. Regime arm
  (`power_capped_frac <= 0.5`) never fired (pcf saturated at 1.000) — binding came solely via the avg-clock
  path.
- **Physical frontier — PARTIAL (did NOT de-collapse).** All dwells were **PowerLimited** with
  **`power_capped_frac=1.000` throughout** (199 W flat). Achieved clocks clustered **~1798–1819 MHz**; all
  targets converged to the same power-bound operating point (vf_bin 1068, 1755 at 1062). Synthesis confidence
  stayed **0.21** (R=0.00); Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm collapsed to **~1800 MHz / 199 W**.
- **Interpretation**: v2 fixed the **procedural** start-bin binding bug (the v1 collapse). The **remaining
  collapse is power/regime-related, not scheduler depth and not the per-target cap** — the card is pinned at
  the 199 W limit, so every target above the power-bound clock degenerates to one point. **Do NOT repeat the
  same hardware run; do NOT increase the per-target cap as the immediate next action (1755 went deeper to 1062
  and still produced ~1811 MHz / 199 W); do NOT jump directly to risky power-limit / clock-lock changes.**
- **Next design work (analysis first, no further confirmed run yet)**: add/adjust **regime-aware binding
  semantics**; distinguish a true `Clock` bind from a `PowerLimitedPlateau` / `PowerBoundCollapse`; consider
  **vetoing `Clock` binding when `power_capped_frac` is saturated near 1.0**; add explicit collapse
  diagnostics and power-headroom / power-drop telemetry. **Stop for analysis before any further confirmed
  hardware run.**
- **Scope of this entry**: docs/continuity only (`handoff.md`, `decisions.md`, `memory.md`). The only commands
  run this validation were one debug build, one dry-run, and one confirmed run — **no code edits, no tests, no
  further hardware**.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-15) — bind-seeking F1b v2 strictness IMPLEMENTED + PUSHED (commit bf02971) — now hardware-validated (see entry above)
- **Commit `bf02971 fix(service): tighten bind-seeking stop criteria`** — pushed to `origin/master`
  (HEAD = origin/master = `bf02971`). Scope: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` ONLY (no other file).
- **Why**: the v1 supervised hardware run (`--bind-seeking`, this session) was **safety/mechanics PASS but
  semantic PARTIAL** — v1 allowed `BoundBinding` on the **first/start bin at 1075 mV**, so every viable target
  stopped immediately with no descent; the frontier stayed degenerate/single-bin (all ~1075 mV / ~199 W) and
  Forge synthesis confidence stayed low (~0.21).
- **v2 changes** (`classify_binding` now returns `BindDecision` and takes an `eligible` flag):
  - **Start bin is NOT bind-eligible** — a target must descend ≥1 real VF bin before `BoundBinding` can fire;
    earliest bind = the **2nd probed real VF bin** (`bind_eligible(probes_before, cur_bin, start_bin)`).
  - **Clock binding uses the AVERAGE/achieved clock** (`avg_clock_mhz - target <= 30`), not p5/sustained;
    p5 remains telemetry/reporting only; zero/absent avg fails closed (no clock binding).
  - **Regime arm unchanged** (`power_capped_frac <= 0.5`) but **invalid/missing cap_frac fails closed**
    (NaN / <0 / >1 → no regime binding, via `valid_cap_frac`).
  - **Bind telemetry** added (live run, per verified+stable probe): `eligible`, `bound`, `reason`
    (`BindReason::None/Clock/Regime`), `avg_clock_mhz`, `p5_clock_mhz`, `power_capped_frac`.
  - **Dry-run** prints the new `binding eligibility: start bin is NOT bind-eligible …` caveat + v2 threshold
    wording (`avg_clock_overshoot <= 30 MHz`).
- **Stop precedence PRESERVED**: crash → abort → budget drain → verifier failure → dwell instability →
  **binding** → per-target cap → floor (only the binding arm is now gated by eligibility).
- **Safety boundaries UNCHANGED**: monotone static-base writer, verifier gates, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`,
  persistence/profile apply, hardware-floor derivation; **warm-start default remains OFF**.
- **Validation before commit (no hardware)**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean; `cargo test -p
  nidavellir-service` **169 passed / 0 failed** (new: start-bin-not-eligible, avg-not-p5, invalid-cap-frac
  fail-closed, skips-start→binds-at-second). **Dry-run only** (no `--confirm`) passed:
  `build-frontier --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21 --max-probes-per-target 3 --safe-start-cap 1075 --bind-seeking`.
  No hardware boundary crossed.
- **Hardware validation: DONE 2026-06-15** (see the FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION entry above) via
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21 --max-probes-per-target 3 --safe-start-cap 1075
  --bind-seeking` — mechanism PASS (start-bin guard), frontier PARTIAL (still power-limited / collapsed).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-14) — bind-seeking F1b v1 IMPLEMENTED + PUSHED, hardware-validated PARTIAL → superseded by v2 (commit 08f745e)
- **Commit `08f745e feat(service): add opt-in bind-seeking to build-frontier`** — pushed to `origin/master`
  (HEAD = origin/master = `08f745e`). Scope: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` +
  `crates/service/src/main.rs` ONLY. This builds the bind-seeking direction set after the `5248758` run.
- **Feature**: new opt-in CLI flag **`--bind-seeking`** + `FrontierLimits.bind_seeking` (default **OFF** —
  absence reproduces current behavior byte-for-byte). Per target, the descent stops at the first verified +
  dwell-stable **binding** point instead of walking a fixed number of bins, so each target can contribute a
  distinguishable point (vs the 1832–1867 MHz / 194–199 W collapse in the `5248758` run).
- **Binding signal v1 (Clock + regime)** — pure `classify_binding`: a verified + stable probe binds iff EITHER
  `sustained - target <= BIND_OVERSHOOT_MHZ (30)` (sustained = p5 if present, else avg) OR
  `power_capped_frac <= BIND_CAP_FRAC (0.5)` (card no longer power-pinned).
- **Power-drop deliberately NOT a v1 stop-condition**: no top-power reference tracking. May become
  telemetry/log later — never a binding/stop rule in v1.
- **Scheduler**: adds `BracketStop::BoundBinding` — a CLEAN stop (`is_hard_failed()==false`), carry-forward
  eligible when it recorded a `lowest_verified_mv`. Binding is checked ONLY on a verified+stable sample, AFTER
  the failure arms. **Precedence preserved**: crash/hard-failure → aborted → global budget drained →
  verifier-failure/unverified → dwell-unstable/silent-error → **then binding** → then per-target cap / floor.
- **Interactions**: `--max-probes` stays the hard global cap; `--max-probes-per-target` stays the per-target
  attempt/depth cap; bind-seeking may stop EARLIER than the per-target cap; **warm-start stays default OFF**.
- **Safety boundaries UNCHANGED**: monotone static-base writer, verifier gates, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`,
  hardware-derived floor, persistence/profile apply — none modified. No power-limit / clock-lock changes.
- **Validation before commit (no hardware)**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean; `cargo test -p
  nidavellir-service` **165 passed / 0 failed** (incl. classifier 30/0.50 boundaries, the full failure
  precedence, BoundBinding carry-forward, and dry-run reporting). **Dry-run only** (no `--confirm`):
  `build-frontier --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21 --max-probes-per-target 3 --safe-start-cap 1075 --bind-seeking`
  → exit 0; printed `bind-seeking: ENABLED`, thresholds (`clock_overshoot <= 30 MHz OR power_capped_frac
  <= 0.50`), the live-metrics caveat, warm-start OFF; **no Safe Loop arm / apply / dwell / VF write**.
- **Hardware validation: NOT yet run for `08f745e`.** Next step (separate, operator-present, NOT this task): a
  clean confirming dry-run, then the supervised confirmed run
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 21 --max-probes-per-target 3 --safe-start-cap 1075 --bind-seeking`.
- **Scope of this entry**: docs/continuity only. No code/test/hardware commands run in the docs pass.

## Latest backend checkpoint (2026-06-13) — F1b `--max-probes-per-target` FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION — coverage PASS / profile PARTIAL (commit 5248758)
- **Supervised confirmed run** (operator present, after a clean confirming dry-run that showed no plan drift;
  HEAD/origin/master at `5248758`; required commits `47f39be`/`f90981d`/`8503182` present;
  `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; `safe_loop.json` idle/`safe_mode:false`):
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 14 --max-probes-per-target 2 --safe-start-cap 1075`
  — **warm-start OFF**. **Exit 0; ~4 min; no TDR, no driver reset, no black-screen, no reboot, no crash markers.**
- **Safety state**: startup recovery clean; Safe Loop armed/cleared **per probe**, ended **idle/disarmed**;
  `reset_to_stock` ran ("GPU restored to stock; no profile applied or persisted"). After:
  `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` **absent**; `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/`heartbeat.txt`
  unchanged (no forge-state persistence, no knowledge write); `safe_loop.json` content/size **unchanged**
  (idle, `safe_mode` false) — mtime touched only, **no new blacklist/crash entry**. GPU back at stock idle.
- **Coverage — PASS (the fix works)**: **13 hardware dwells spread across all 7 targets** (not depth-first on
  one). 6 targets stopped cleanly via **`PerTargetCap`** (`probes_used=2` each, bins **1075 + 1068 mV**);
  global `--max-probes 14` was **not exhausted** (13 used). The per-target cap successfully prevented one
  target from consuming the whole budget — the exact fix vs the prior 34-on-1935 depth-first run.
- **Target 1905 dropped** after its 1st probe: ceiling 1075 mV → **`LiveMismatch`**, **`overshoot_veto=true`**,
  `eff_cov=0.963`, 1 unexplained zero — a conservative verifier rejection (neighbors 1935 `NoDownCapNeeded`
  and 1875 `VerifiedCurve` passed), not a hardware fault. **6/7 produced frontier points.**
- **Writer/verifier**: every probe `write_mode=monotone_static`, `positive_offsets=0`; verdicts
  `NoDownCapNeededCeiling` (1935) + `VerifiedCurve` (1875–1755). No VF persistence; no Safe Loop / reset /
  verifier / writer regression. Voltage band shallow only — **1075 and 1068 mV**; did **not** touch
  875/868/862/856/850 mV (the cap-2 stop holds at the top two bins).
- **Profile goal — PARTIAL**: lower targets did **not** produce distinct clock/power. Achieved clocks
  clustered **1832–1867 MHz**, power **194–199 W**; the live plateau stayed ~1890 MHz with `overshoot`
  growing 1875:+30 → 1755:+135 → the near-stock flatten does not govern the achieved clock.
  Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm collapsed to one point (**1860 MHz / 194 W**, target 1755); FORGE confidence
  stayed low (best 0.21, single-trial → best-effort synthesis).
- **Key conclusion**: **shallow near-stock coverage at 1075/1068 mV is non-binding on this hard power-capped
  RTX 3060 Ti** — the ceiling does not materially govern the achieved clock at that high-voltage band.
  `--max-probes-per-target` **solved budget distribution, not binding/differentiation**.
- **Direction (next design = bind-seeking F1b)**: do NOT repeat the same flags; do NOT use per-target cap 3
  next; do NOT enable warm-start next; do NOT jump straight to power-limit/clock-lock changes. Instead, per
  target: **keep descending while the point is stable but non-binding, and stop when it actually BINDS** (the
  ceiling materially governs the clock), fails the verifier/dwell, or hits the global/per-target cap — the
  goal is the **first useful (binding) point per target**, not the deepest voltage. **No further hardware
  commands were run.**
- **Scope**: docs/continuity only (`handoff.md`, `decisions.md`, `memory.md`). No code/test/IPC/hardware
  change in this pass.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-13) — Hardware-derived / bin-based floor FIRST CONFIRMED HARDWARE VALIDATION — PASS (commit f90981d)
- **Supervised confirmed run** (operator present, after a clean bounded dry-run on a fresh debug build;
  HEAD/origin/master at `c99dbf1`+`f90981d`; required commits `23b70c4`/`8503182` present;
  `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; `safe_loop.json` idle/`safe_mode:false`):
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 34 --safe-start-cap 1075 --warm-start-brackets`.
  `--max-probes 34` was chosen so the descent reaches **868 mV** (one real bin below the old 875 mV floor)
  but stops BEFORE **862 mV** (a historical reboot-zone / blacklisted bin). **Exit 0; no TDR, no driver
  reset, no black-screen, no reboot, no crash markers.**
- **Safety state**: startup recovery clean ("clean boot, nothing to restore"); Safe Loop armed at startup
  and cleared back to **idle**; `reset_to_stock` ran ("GPU restored to stock; no profile applied or
  persisted"). After: `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` **absent** (as before); `forge_state.json`/
  `gpu_knowledge.json`/`heartbeat.txt` unchanged; `safe_loop.json` **byte-identical** (idle, `safe_mode`
  false, size unchanged) — mtime touched at run start only, **no new blacklist/crash entry**
  (`consecutive_crashes` still 1, `crash_log` still `["unrelated"]`). GPU back at stock idle.
- **Probe budget — 34 hardware dwells, ALL on target 1935** (ceilings 1075→868 mV; benign_zeros 27→60).
  The per-target `bracket_carry` line logs `probes_used=35` with `stop_reason=BudgetExhausted` — the 35th
  increment is the scheduler ATTEMPTING the next step (→862 mV) and finding the budget spent; **no
  `ceiling_mv=862` line exists; 862 mV was never set or dwelled.** Targets 1905/1875/1845/1815/1785/1755
  were NOT physically characterized this run (budget exhausted on the hardest target; each logged a
  `probes_used=1` bookkeeping entry, no dwell, "no stable point in safe range — dropped").
- **Voltage coverage**: reached **875 mV** (probe 33) and **868 mV** (probe 34), both
  `NoDownCapNeededCeiling`, `eff_cov=1.000`, `overshoot=0`; **did NOT reach 862 mV**. Safety goal met —
  validated **one real bin below the old 875 mV floor** while **avoiding the historical 862/855 mV
  reboot-zone bins** on this first bounded run. Warm-start observed: 1935 started from cap 1075
  (`warm_started=false`); 1905 carried 1935's bracket (`warm_started=true`, `start_mv=893` = 868 + 25 mV).
- **Writer/verifier**: every probe `write_mode=monotone_static`, `positive_offsets=0`, `down_caps=0`, no
  `overshoot_veto`, all verified `NoDownCapNeededCeiling`, `eff_cov=1.000`.
- **IMPORTANT interpretation**: this validated **safe WRITING/descent of the static VF ceiling down to
  868 mV** — it did NOT prove core stability when actually RUN at 868 mV. The GPU stayed **power-limited
  (~198 W)** the whole descent, so the ceiling was **non-binding** (the core's power-governed operating
  point was already at/below each ceiling → no down-cap needed). Frontier point: 1935 target →
  **1839 MHz @ 868 mV vf_bin, 198 W** (p5 1800). **PASS for the first bin-based floor validation;
  partial/insufficient for profile synthesis** — FORGE confidence stayed low (best 0.21), single
  sustainable clock (1800 MHz), so Godforge/Brokkr's/Deep Calm collapsed identical.
- **Direction**: do NOT jump straight to `--max-probes 40`. `--max-probes 35` would deliberately touch
  **862 mV** if the goal is pure reboot-zone boundary mapping (operator present; NB the 862 blacklist
  entry is keyed `freq=1755`, so a 1935-target ceiling at 862 would not match it — Safe Loop is the
  backstop, not prevention), but that is NOT the best path for useful profiles. **Primary next step: pivot
  to F1b / multi-clock characterization, and/or a regime that makes the ceiling actually BIND (e.g. raise
  the power limit) before descending deeper** — since the descent was power-limited, deeper ceilings add
  reboot-zone exposure for ~zero characterization gain. **No further hardware commands were run.**

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-13) — Hardware-derived / bin-based build-frontier floor SHIPPED (commit f90981d)
- **Change** (`f90981d feat(service): derive build-frontier floor from real VF bins`, on `origin/master`):
  the hardcoded active **875 mV** descent floor is GONE. `build-frontier` now derives the floor from the
  GPU's real VF / core-cluster voltage bins — `hw_floor_mv = seed.cluster_v_min_mv` (lowest real
  graphics-core bin). No replacement fixed floor (no 825/800); `FRONTIER_LOWEST_SAFE_MV` deleted.
- **Bin-based descent**: `FrontierDescent` carries `bins_desc` (real descending bins) built by
  `derive_descent` from `CoreSeed.cluster_bins_mv`; `descend_target` walks **real bins only** — it does
  NOT invent 25 mV requested voltages off the curve. Warm-start snaps its margin to the **conservative
  real bin ≥ the requested margin target** and **never starts below the previous `lowest_verified_mv`**
  (B1). `--max-probes` remains the exposure cap; `--warm-start-brackets` stays default OFF; no new flag.
  Empty/underivable bin domain → **fail closed before any hardware write**. Dry-run prints the
  hardware-derived floor, the exact descent bin sequence, the real bin count, and worst-case dwells.
- **Scope**: only `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`. **Unchanged**: monotone static-base writer,
  verifier gates, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`, persistence, profile apply. `cargo check` clean;
  `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` **142 passed**.
- **Historical note**: the older `1755 @ 875` validations below remain valid for that point but are NO
  LONGER the active floor; future runs may descend **below 875** where real bins exist + budget allows.
- **NOT hardware-validated yet.** The descent may now reach **below the historical ~855 mV reboot zone**.
  **Suggested next operational step (DRY-RUN ONLY, no `--confirm`):**
  `build-frontier --max-targets 7 --max-probes 70 --safe-start-cap 1075 --warm-start-brackets` → review
  the hardware-derived floor, exact bin sequence, worst-case dwell count, and whether `--max-probes` is
  enough. ONLY THEN consider a separate supervised `--confirm` run (operator present + able to reboot).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-13) — Warm-start voltage-bracket carry-forward SHIPPED + HARDWARE-VALIDATED (commits 23b70c4, 6f2f061)
- **Feature** (`23b70c4 feat(service): add warm-start bracket carry-forward`, on `origin/master`):
  a **generic** scheduler primitive (NOT Godforge-specific) for ordered hardest→easiest core-clock
  voltage descents. An easier target reuses the previous harder target's verified + dwell-stable
  bracket as its descent start (`lowest_verified_mv + 1 step`), skipping dominated high-voltage
  probes. Opt-in CLI flag **`--warm-start-brackets`, default OFF** — no runtime behavior changes
  unless the flag is passed. Preserves the monotone static-base VF writer, verifier gates,
  `overshoot_veto`, Safe Loop, `reset_to_stock`, persistence/profile apply, and the 875 mV floor.
  Safety constraints B1/B2/B3 (see `decisions.md`).
- **Hardware validation (2026-06-13) — PASS.** Supervised
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 40 --safe-start-cap 1075 --warm-start-brackets`
  on a fresh debug build, after a clean bounded dry-run (warm-start shown ENABLED;
  `gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; state mtimes unchanged). **Exit 0; no TDR/reboot**;
  startup recovery clean; Safe Loop armed/cleared per probe; `reset_to_stock` ran ("GPU restored to
  stock"). After: `boot_flag.json`/`gpu_applied.json` absent; `forge_state.json`/`gpu_knowledge.json`/
  `heartbeat.txt` unchanged; `safe_loop.json` mtime touched at run start (idle/disarmed, size
  unchanged); GPU back at stock idle.
- **Scheduler behavior (33 probes, all 7 targets produced points):**
  - 1935 (first) started at cap 1075, descended to floor 875 (boost-top NoDownCapNeeded everywhere),
    `lowest_verified=875`.
  - **B2 exercised — 1905**: inherited an optimistic 900 mV warm start from 1935's boost-top bracket,
    failed verify at 900 (`LiveMismatch`, `overshoot_veto=true`) → **fell back ONCE to cap 1075**,
    re-descended, target preserved (point at 1075). Fallback did not loop and did not fire on a drain.
  - 1875/1845 collapsed to cap (`lv+step ≥ cap`); 1815/1785/1755 warm-started below cap and skipped
    1 / 2 / 3 dominated high-V probes respectively.
  - **Probes: 33** vs **32** baseline (≈ flat raw) but **−5 vs the equivalent from-cap descent (38)**
    for an identical frontier — net of one B2-fallback probe. Benefit is modest on this RTX 3060 Ti
    because mid targets stop early on verify-axis residual overshoot regardless of start voltage.
- **Frontier preserved.** Critical low-V region re-validated exactly: **`1755 @ 900`**
  `NoDownCapNeededCeiling`, plateau **1665..1755**, overshoot 0, dwell stable; **`1755 @ 875`**
  `NoDownCapNeededCeiling`, plateau **1620..1755**, overshoot 0, ≈**1755 MHz @ 875 mV, ≈176 W**.
  Every probe `write_mode=monotone_static`, `positive_offsets=0`. Residual single-bin 15 MHz
  overshoot on non-1755 targets persists (safe verify-axis early stop, as before). FORGE synthesis
  low confidence (best 0.21) — unrelated Wilson metric.
- **B1/B2/B3 held in live logs** (B2 actually exercised). Feature is hardware-validated as **safe
  behind the opt-in flag**.
- **Observability follow-up** (`6f2f061 feat(service): surface build-frontier scheduler logs`):
  log-only. `run_build_frontier` previously emitted only `result.profiles.log`; now emits the
  scheduler/frontier `result.log` (bracket carry / warm-start / fallback / probes_used) FIRST, then
  the synthesis log, deduping shared lines (pure `ordered_frontier_logs` helper + 2 unit tests). No
  tuning behavior changed. Closes the validation finding that bracket telemetry existed but was
  invisible in CLI output.
- **Keep `--warm-start-brackets` default OFF** until more runs justify flipping it. **Next** (later,
  optional): 1–2 more warm-start runs; a benign-zero-only (NoDownCapNeeded) bracket-seeding refinement
  so a boost-top bracket doesn't mis-seed the next sub-boost target (the 1905 B2 case); broader
  frontier/profile confidence work. **Do NOT mix with profile persistence yet.**

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-12) — Phase 2B.2-c: monotone static-base VF writer HARDWARE-VALIDATED (commit 8503182)
- **Milestone — supervised hardware revalidation of the monotone static-base VF ceiling writer.**
  After a clean bounded dry-run on a fresh `origin/master` debug build at `8503182`
  (`gpu_applied.json`/`boot_flag.json` absent; state mtimes unchanged), the user approved one
  confirmed run: `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 7 --max-probes 40 --safe-start-cap 1075`.
- **Safety: exit 0, no TDR, no reboot.** Startup recovery clean ("clean boot, nothing to restore");
  Safe Loop armed for the VF writes and cleared; `reset_to_stock` ran at the end ("GPU restored to
  stock; no profile applied or persisted"). After the run: `boot_flag.json` absent,
  `gpu_applied.json` absent; `forge_state.json` / `gpu_knowledge.json` / `heartbeat.txt` unchanged
  (build-frontier never persists); `safe_loop.json` mtime touched at run start, size unchanged
  (startup-recovery bookkeeping only). GPU back at stock idle (nvidia-smi ~66 W / 7% util / 200 W
  limit). The audited safety contract held end-to-end on real hardware.
- **Functional: monotone writer confirmed working.** Every one of the **32 probes** logged
  `write_mode=monotone_static` with **`positive_offsets=0`** (static-base-anchored monotone-down
  offsets only) over `static_base_points=132`.
- **Primary fixed case — `1755 @ 900 mV` no longer overshoots.**
  - OLD: raw_cov 0.891, eff_cov 1.000, **`overshoot_veto=true`**, plateau **1755..1845**, result
    **`LiveMismatch`** (blocked).
  - NEW: `positive_offsets=0`, eff_cov 1.000, **overshoot=0**, plateau **1665..1755** (max 1755),
    veto not triggered, result **`NoDownCapNeededCeiling`** (pass). Plateau max dropped 1845 → 1755
    exactly; overshoot collapsed to 0.
- **Run continued to `1755 @ 875 mV` and it verified**: `NoDownCapNeededCeiling`, overshoot=0,
  plateau **1620..1755**, dwelled (~19 s); achieved ≈ **1755 MHz @ 875 mV, ≈179 W**. The `1755`
  ceiling descent shows overshoot decaying cleanly to 0 from 950 mV down (950/925/900/875 all
  overshoot=0).
- **Minor residual (not a blocker for the writer fix)**: a few **non-1755** probes at low ceilings
  still show a single-bin **15 MHz** overshoot with `overshoot_veto=true` (e.g. 1905@1050, 1875@950,
  1845@975, 1815@950, 1785@950). All `1755` probes are overshoot=0.
- **Unrelated note**: FORGE synthesis reported low confidence (best 0.21 < 0.85) → best-effort
  profiles. This is the single-trial Wilson confidence metric, not a writer/overshoot issue.
- **Next technical phase**: design **warm-started voltage-bracket reuse** for F1b / Godforge (carry
  a verified bracket forward across targets to cut probes). **Do NOT mix this with persistence /
  profile apply yet** — keep build-frontier non-persisting until the bracket-reuse design lands.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-11) — Phase 2B.2-c: FIRST confirmed run (SAFE, 0 points) + c.1 stock-equivalent verifier fix (IMPLEMENTED, not committed)
- **Milestone — first supervised hardware run executed.** After a Fable 5 blocker audit (GO) and a
  clean bounded dry-run (fresh worktree debug build of 6881cd7; `gpu_applied.json` absent; mtimes
  unchanged), the user approved and we ran
  `build-frontier --confirm --max-targets 1 --max-probes 6 --safe-start-cap 1075`.
  **Safety: exit 0, no TDR, no reboot (~10 s)**; startup recovery clean; Safe Loop armed before the
  VF write and cleared after; `reset_to_stock` fired on the verify reject and again at run end; no
  profile applied/persisted (`gpu_applied.json` absent; `forge_state`/`gpu_knowledge` mtimes
  unchanged; `safe_loop.json` re-saved by startup recovery = bookkeeping only); GPU back at stock
  idle (1% util / 44 °C / 64 W). The full audited safety contract held on real hardware.
- **Functional: 0 frontier points.** The only probe — target=1935 (the stock cluster boost top),
  ceiling 1075 mV — was rejected by the verify gate: `verify=LiveMismatch offsets=20/27
  plateau=1935..1935 overshoot=0`, so the descent stopped before any dwell. Root cause: flatten-to-
  boost-top needs ZERO offset on the 7 top bins already at 1935 in stock → the ≥90% offset-presence
  gate under-counts. The frequency evidence (plateau exactly at target, no overshoot) showed the
  ceiling WAS in effect.
- **c.1 fix (this checkpoint, code+tests only, NO hardware run yet)**: narrow stock-equivalent
  acceptance — pure `is_stock_equivalent_ceiling` in `gpu_verify.rs`, consulted ONLY on a
  `LiveMismatch`, accepting only when: target within tol of the caller-supplied stock boost top;
  ALL offsets readable; NO bin above target (overshoot rejected even within tol); all bins within
  tol below target; every zero-offset bin EXACTLY at target (offset 0 ⇒ GetStatus shows stock base;
  correct flatten writes `target−base`, so only `base==target` explains a missing offset). Carried
  as service-internal `LiveCeilingEval.stock_equivalent` + `stock_equivalent_bins`;
  **`CurveVerification` IPC untouched**. `eval_ceiling_evidence`/`classify_live_ceiling` gain
  `stock_top_mhz: Option<u32>`; `verify_applied_curve` passes `None` (byte-identical);
  `real_probe_step` passes `Some(seed.stock_boost_max_mhz)`, accepts `VerifiedCurve ||
  stock_equivalent`, logs the branch as `verify=StockEquivalentCeiling stock_equiv_bins=N`.
  Safe-Loop/reset/abort flow in the probe unchanged. Condition 1 is DIRECTIONAL (`target ≤ top &&
  top − target ≤ tol`) — a target above the stock top is an overclock, never stock-equivalent.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`, `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`.
- **Tests**: `cargo check` clean · service **109/109** (+11: first-run reproduction accepted;
  plateau-miss / any-overshoot / below-boost-top / zero-offset-not-exact / no-stock-top /
  unreadable-offset all rejected; normal VerifiedCurve never consults the path; fully-degenerate
  all-zero-at-target accepted; tol-boundary accept@15 / reject@16 on bin-freq AND target-vs-top;
  directional above-top reject) · core 46/46.
- **Next**: re-run the bounded DRY-RUN on the rebuilt binary, then (user approval required) the
  SAME bounded `--confirm` — expect the 1935-target probe to verify stock-equivalent and dwell
  (~6 probes, ~120 s). 11D (persisted stock base / exact-offset proof) still deferred.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-08) — F1b Phase 2B.2-c.0: first-run limiter flags (pushed, 6881cd7)
- **Bounded first run.** `build-frontier` gains `--max-targets N`, `--max-probes N`,
  `--safe-start-cap MV` so the first supervised QA validates the pipeline without the full 84-dwell
  plan. Dry-run + confirmed both honor them; defaults preserve the full plan.
- **Behavior**: `--max-targets` truncates to the top N; `--safe-start-cap` lowers the descent start
  to the cap when below the derived cluster top (never raises above it, never below the crash floor);
  `--max-probes` hard-stops total probe executions (short-circuits remaining, then resets to stock +
  clears the flag). FAIL CLOSED on absurd values (0; cap ≤ crash floor; non-numeric/missing).
- **Pure helpers**: `FrontierLimits` / `validate_limits` / `apply_frontier_limits` (gpu_power_sweep);
  `parse_frontier_limits` (main.rs). Dry-run prints a `limits` line + the capped dwell budget.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`, `crates/service/src/main.rs`. **No IPC/contract/
  core/apps-ui/Safe-Loop/gpu_apply/nvml_gpu/Phase-3/11D change; no auto-apply; no persistence; no
  hardware.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check` clean · service **95/95** (+7: validate/apply/max-probes-cap + 3 parse
  tests) · core 46/46.
- **Dry-run QA** (stock, no --confirm, no state-file writes — mtimes unchanged):
  `build-frontier --max-targets 1 --max-probes 6 --safe-start-cap 1075` → targets=[1935],
  descent 1075→875 mV (9 bins), 6 dwells (~120 s, capped by --max-probes). NB: the soft-max warning
  still cites the derived cluster top (1150 mV) even when --safe-start-cap lowers the effective start
  (1075) — accurate about the curve, cosmetic next to the capped descent.
- **Next — Phase 2B.2-c (supervised hardware QA, separately gated)**: a bounded `--confirm` run
  (e.g. the flags above) with the user present and able to reboot. 11D deferred to after Phase 2B.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.2-b.4: stock core VF cluster seeding (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Refines b.3.** b.3's generic guard rejected absurd values but still let `safe_start` = global max
  of all sane points (1150 mV on the 3060 Ti — the hard-cap boundary / a non-core point). b.4 derives
  safe_start/boost from the actual contiguous core VF cluster instead.
- **`select_core_cluster`** (pure, `gpu_power_sweep.rs`): sort sane points by voltage; split into
  contiguous runs where voltage gap ≤ 60 mV; pick the LARGEST (ties → lowest voltage = dense core);
  FAIL CLOSED if < 8 points. `derive_core_seed` seeds boost/safe_start from the cluster top and
  reports isolated high-V outliers above it. b.3 generic hard guards (500..3500 MHz, 600..1150 mV)
  retained.
- **Dry-run diagnostics** now print raw/retained/rejected counts, rejected extremes, selected
  core-cluster mV+MHz range, outliers-above count, stock reference (cluster top), safe_start source,
  and a WARNING when a profile appears applied (`gpu_apply::load_applied()`).
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` + docs. **No IPC/contract/core/apps-ui/Safe-Loop/
  gpu_apply/nvml_gpu/Phase-3/11D change; no auto-reset; no hardware.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **88/88** (cluster tests: isolated
  1150 rejected; ends-at-1075→1075; legit-1150→1150; empty/ambiguous fail-closed; targets seed from
  cluster not outlier; diagnostics report cluster range) · core 46/46.
- **Stock dry-run QA PENDING the user's manual reset to stock** (this patch does NOT auto-reset).
  Then run `nidavellir-service.exe build-frontier` (no --confirm) and confirm: no arm/apply/dwell/
  VF-write, no state-file mtime change, plausible targets, safe_start = stock core cluster top,
  applied-profile warning if not reset. **`--confirm` remains forbidden until reviewed.**
- NB: b.3 + b.4 are both UNCOMMITTED — the eventual commit bundles them unless split. Future: NVML
  `max_clock_info(Graphics)` could corroborate boost (nvml_gpu.rs frozen here).

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.2-b.3: core-domain seeding guard (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Safety fix.** The first `build-frontier` dry-run (read-only) caught a seeding bug:
  `run_build_frontier` derived candidate clocks + safe_start from the UNFILTERED global max of
  `read_vf_curve_modern()` (includes non-core / memory-domain points) → bogus plan (targets
  7001..6311 MHz, safe_start 1237 mV). The dry-run gate blocked it with zero hardware risk.
- **Guard** (pure, `gpu_power_sweep.rs`): `sane_core_points` keeps freq ∈ [500,3500] MHz & voltage ∈
  [600,1150] mV; `derive_core_seed` seeds boost/sustained/safe_start from sane points only, records
  rejected max freq/voltage, soft-warns (>3200 MHz / >1125 mV), FAILS CLOSED (Err) if no sane points
  or a derived value exceeds a hard guard. `run_build_frontier` aborts (no arm/apply/dwell/VF-write)
  on Err or any candidate target > 3500 MHz. Consts are sanity guards, NOT tuning targets.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` + docs. **No IPC/contract/core/apps-ui/
  Safe-Loop-behavior/gpu_apply/nvml_gpu/Phase-3/11D change; no auto-reset; no hardware.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **86/86** (+5 guard tests:
  sane_core rejects 7001/1237 & keeps plausible; seed uses sane max not global max; fail-closed on no
  sane points; targets never > hard max; soft-limit warnings) · core 46/46.
- **Dry-run QA (read-only, no --confirm, no state writes — all 4 mtimes unchanged)**: 132 raw VF
  points → 88 sane-core retained, 44 rejected (incl. 7001 MHz / 1237 mV); boost~1935 MHz; targets
  [1935,1905,1875,1845,1815,1785,1755]; 1150→875 mV step 25 (12 bins); 84 worst-case dwells
  (~1680 s); WARNING safe_start 1150 mV > soft max 1125 mV. **NB**: the live curve is in an APPLIED
  state, so the numbers reflect the applied curve, not stock; a stock read (reset first) would be
  cleaner, and safe_start 1150 mV is high for a 3060 Ti core (~1075) → review before --confirm.
- **`--confirm` remains forbidden** until this fixed plan is reviewed. **Next — Phase 2B.2-c**
  (supervised hardware QA, separately gated): optionally reset to stock first for a clean plan,
  re-review the dry-run, then `--confirm` with the user present and able to reboot. 11D deferred.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.2-b.2: real probe + supervised build-frontier (CODE ONLY, not run, not pushed)
- **Real Windows probe `real_probe_step`** (the `build_frontier` seam under `--confirm`):
  abort/boundary guard → snap vbin to a real VF bin → arm Safe Loop → `apply_vf_ceiling(bin,target)`
  → read-only verify via shared `classify_live_ceiling` (+ 11C diag log) → on not-VerifiedCurve
  reset+clear+return → `load_and_measure` dwell → clear flag → `measured_to_probe` + set `vf_bin_mv`.
  Dwell CRASH → reset to stock + set `abort` so remaining probes short-circuit (run drains safely);
  a normal Unstable/unverified only stops that clock's descent.
- **`run_build_frontier(store, confirm)`** + console `build-frontier` (main.rs): always prints the
  `plan_frontier` plan. Dry-run (no `--confirm`) = read-only (no arm/apply/dwell/VF-write, no startup
  recovery). `--confirm` = startup recovery (parachute) first, then `build_frontier` with the real
  probe, then ALWAYS `reset_to_stock` + clears the flag. **No auto-apply; no forge_state; no
  gpu_knowledge writes.**
- **Conservative first-run consts** (review the printed dry-run plan before any run): lowest_safe=875
  mV (above the ~855 mV known reboot), 25 mV step, 30 MHz clock step, 0.90 floor; idle Unconstrained
  regime clamped → PowerLimited (no OC on a first run); sustained ≈ curve top freq; confidence 0.21.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`, `crates/service/src/main.rs`. **No IPC/contract
  /core/apps-ui/Safe-Loop-behavior/gpu_apply/nvml_gpu/Phase-3/11D change. Hardware path NOT executed.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **81/81** (+1 `--confirm` arg parse)
  · core 46/46. `real_probe_step`/`run_build_frontier` are hardware → not unit-tested; the abort
  short-circuit PATTERN is covered by the 2B.2-b.1 fake-probe test.
- **Commands**: dry-run `nidavellir-service.exe build-frontier`; confirmed (DO NOT RUN until QA)
  `nidavellir-service.exe build-frontier --confirm`.
- **Next — Phase 2B.2-c (supervised hardware QA, separately gated)**: run the dry-run, review the
  plan, then `--confirm` with the user present and able to reboot; verify gpu_applied.json /
  forge_state.json unchanged, boot flag armed/cleared per probe, abort on TDR. 11D deferred to after
  Phase 2B.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.2-b.1: seeding + dry-run plan + vf_bin (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Pure prep for 2B.2-b.** Exposed `classify_live_ceiling` / `LiveCeilingEval` / `CurveDiag` as
  `pub(crate)` in `gpu_verify.rs` (intra-crate visibility only — NO IPC/contract change) so the
  future transient-ceiling probe reuses one classification path.
- **Pure seeding** in `gpu_power_sweep.rs`: `derive_descent(curve_bins, lowest_safe, step) ->
  FrontierDescent` (safe_start = top live bin, clamped ≥ operator crash floor) + read-only
  `plan_frontier(targets, &descent, dwell_ms) -> FrontierPlan` (worst-case dwell count + wall-time +
  safety notice). Targets via existing `classify_regime` / `candidate_clocks`.
- **Internal `ProbeSample.vf_bin_mv: Option<u32>`** (NOT IPC): the actually-applied snapped bin.
  `probe_to_point` records `vf_table_voltage_mv = vf_bin_mv.or(descent vbin)`; `measured_to_probe`
  leaves it None (the real probe fills it after the apply in 2B.2-b.2).
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`, `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`. **No real
  probe; no `apply_vf_ceiling`/`load_and_measure`; no `build-frontier` subcommand / `--confirm`; no
  Safe-Loop arm/clear; no startup-recovery wiring; no forge_state / gpu_knowledge writes; no
  Phase-3/11D/apps-ui/core/contract change; no hardware.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **80/80** (+7 pure: regime→targets,
  derive_descent, plan_frontier estimates, vf_bin propagation + fallback, mapper-leaves-None,
  build_frontier abort short-circuit via fake probe) · core 46/46 (untouched).
- **Next — Phase 2B.2-b.2 (NOT started, separately gated)**: real `#[cfg(windows)]` probe closure
  (arm Safe Loop → `apply_vf_ceiling(vbin,target)` → `classify_live_ceiling` verify + 11C diag →
  `load_and_measure` dwell → clear → `measured_to_probe` + set `vf_bin_mv`) + supervised
  `build-frontier --confirm` console subcommand (dry-run default via `plan_frontier`; runs startup
  recovery; print/log-only, no auto-apply, no persistence). Then supervised hardware QA (2B.2-c).
  11D deferred to after Phase 2B.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.2-a: shared live-ceiling classifier (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Pure refactor** in `gpu_verify.rs`: extracted `classify_live_ceiling(live, ceiling_idx,
  ceiling_mv, target, tol)` (read-only; offset-readback evidence build) + pure
  `eval_ceiling_evidence(target, anchor_idx, &expected, tol)` (runs the UNCHANGED offset-presence
  `classify_curve` gate + 11C `compute_curve_diag`) → `LiveCeilingEval`. `verify_applied_curve` now
  routes through it.
- **Behavior identical**: `VerifyAppliedProfile` output is byte-for-byte unchanged (same classifier,
  diagnostic, inputs); only inline duplication removed. Offset-presence stays the gate; plateau spread
  stays diagnostic; voltage never affects classification. This is the shared path the 2B.2-b
  transient-ceiling probe will reuse to verify a JUST-applied ceiling (not the persisted profile).
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs` only. **No core/contract/`apps/ui`/Safe-Loop/synthesis
  /Phase-3/11D change; no real probe; no `apply_vf_ceiling`/`load_and_measure`; no `build-frontier`
  subcommand; no hardware.** Pure seeding helpers deferred to 2B.2-b (would be dead code now).
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **73/73** (+5 `eval_ceiling_*` pure
  tests; all pre-existing verify tests green) · core 46/46.
- **Next — Phase 2B.2-b (NOT started, separately gated)**: real `#[cfg(windows)]` probe closure (arm
  Safe Loop → `apply_vf_ceiling(vbin,target)` → `classify_live_ceiling` verify + 11C diag →
  `load_and_measure` dwell → clear → `measured_to_probe`) + supervised `build-frontier --confirm`
  console subcommand (print/log-only; runs startup recovery; no auto-apply). Then supervised hardware
  QA. 11D deferred to after Phase 2B.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-07) — F1b Phase 2B.1: pure probe-mapping prep (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Pure, hardware-free half of Phase 2B.** `measured_to_probe(&Measured, curve_verified, confidence)
  -> ProbeSample` in `gpu_power_sweep.rs` — the seam the real probe closure (2B.2) will use to feed
  `build_frontier`. No hardware I/O; conservative interpretation of already-collected dwell data only.
- **Conservative rules**: Stable→`ProbeOutcome::Stable` ONLY if clock/power quality ≥ Medium AND p5
  present; else (SilentError / Crash / TDR-degenerate, or weak telemetry) → Unstable. p5 preserved
  (0 → None); measured voltage = ramp-filtered avg, None when missing (never 0).
- **Additive schema**: `PowerSweepPoint.target_clock_mhz: Option<u32>` (serde default, no schema
  bump). Phase 2A `probe_to_point` now stamps the target; the single-clock live sweep sets None.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`, `crates/core/src/ipc.rs`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`, decisions/memory/handoff. **No real probe, no `apply_vf_ceiling`,
  no `load_and_measure` loop, no supervised console cmd, no Safe-Loop/synthesis/`apps/ui`/Phase-3/11D,
  no hardware.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **68/68** (+7 mapping/target tests) ·
  core **46/46** (+2 serde roundtrip + legacy-load). No hardware run.
- **Next — Phase 2B.2 (NOT started, separately gated)**: the real `#[cfg(windows)]` probe closure
  (arm Safe Loop → `apply_vf_ceiling(vbin,target)` → read-only offset-readback verify + 11C diag →
  `load_and_measure` dwell → clear → `measured_to_probe`) + a supervised console subcommand that calls
  `build_frontier` with it behind explicit confirm. Then a supervised hardware QA run. 11D
  (exact-offset stock-base persistence) deferred to AFTER Phase 2B unless QA shows need.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — Patch 11C: read-only live VF-ceiling diagnostic (IMPLEMENTED, not pushed)
- **Read-only diagnostic** added to `gpu_verify::verify_applied_curve` (and the `verify-applied`
  console subcommand): pure `compute_curve_diag` over the existing per-point evidence + one
  `LiveSnapshot`. No mutation, no stress, no apply. Classifier semantics UNCHANGED (offset-presence
  gate; live voltage above the VF anchor never downgrades; GetStatus freq stays diagnostic).
- **New evidence**: first modified bin idx/mv, modified vs expected bin count, GetStatus freq-match,
  GetStatus plateau min/max MHz, max target overshoot/undershoot, 3 offset samples (first/anchor/
  highest), and a live snapshot (NVAPI voltage + first NVML clock/power/util/temp/limit/cap). Surfaced
  via additive `Option`/`serde(default)` fields on `ApplyVerificationStatus` + one `apply_verify_diag:`
  log line. Additive IPC documented in `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`, `crates/core/src/ipc.rs`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`, `decisions.md`, `memory.md`, this file. **No apply/Safe-Loop/
  synthesis/F1b/`apps/ui`/`nvml_gpu.rs` change. P-state + full ThrottleReasons deferred.**
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service **61/61** (+9 pure diag tests) ·
  core **44/44** (additive serde fields, nothing broken).
- **Runtime QA** (`verify-applied`, read-only — confirmed non-mutating: all four
  `%ProgramData%\Nidavellir\*.json` mtimes unchanged across the run): curve=`VerifiedCurve` (62/64
  offsets present), load=`VerifiedUnderLoad`. Diagnostic revealed `anchor_offset_khz=+255000`,
  `highest_bin_offset_khz=−120000`, GetStatus plateau **1770–1830 MHz** (overshoot 45, undershoot 15),
  live `voltage_mv=1068 clock_mhz=1815 util_pct=6 temp_c=47 power_w=66 cap=200W capped=false`.
  Interpretation: offsets are resident and *curve-flatten-shaped* (big `+` at the 843 mV anchor, `−`
  at the top) → curve IS applied; the plateau spread + overshoot is consistent with BOTH normal
  GPU-Boost behavior AND the open overshoot suspect, but GetStatus idle noise (freq_match 18/64) keeps
  it **non-conclusive** — exactly what 11C was meant to surface. Live voltage 1068 mV ≫ 843 mV anchor
  confirms (again) measured voltage is NOT capped (telemetry only).
- **Exact-offset verification still deferred**: expected offset = `target − stock_base_mhz`, but
  per-point stock base is not persisted and GetStatus freq is idle-unreliable. Future "11D" options:
  persist the pre-apply stock curve, or validate the GetStatus `base` tuple (`StatusEntry.base`,
  currently decoded but discarded in `vfcurve::get_status`). Only then can the overshoot suspect be
  proven/refuted.
- **F1b Phase 2B**: still NOT started; UNBLOCKED by this diagnostic — Phase 2B's `curve_verified`
  gate (offset-readback) is the same axis 11C reports, so the supervised HW run can now log the
  plateau/offset evidence per dwell. Sequence the Codex copy fix + (optionally) 11D before relying on
  exact-offset proof.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — Applied voltage semantics (Patch 11A, DOCS ONLY, not pushed)
- **Read-only investigation** confirmed the elastic VF ceiling caps **frequency, not voltage**:
  `apply_vf_ceiling` (`crates/gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs`) writes per-point FREQUENCY offsets to every
  modern VF point whose table voltage ≥ the selected bin (flatten to `target_mhz`); points below
  are untouched. It writes **no voltage** and does **not** hard-cap measured/rail voltage in any
  P-state. The apply key is the deterministic `vf_table_voltage_mv` (VF/curve bin), re-derived by
  snapping measured voltage UP to the lowest table bin ≥ it (`nearest_vf_bin_at_or_above`).
- **Semantics resolved**: `measured_voltage_mv` / HWiNFO "GPU Core Voltage" are a DIFFERENT (rail,
  load-line/droop) domain and may legitimately read ABOVE the VF bin — idle ~1.075 V and in-game
  ~0.887–0.956 V for an ~850 mV bin are EXPECTED, not a mismatch. `VerifyAppliedProfile` proves
  offset PRESENCE (+ a stored-dwell load axis), nothing about effective voltage. Nidavellir must
  NOT imply a hard voltage cap; a true cap = the legacy voltage-lock (TDR) path → rejected.
- **Patch 11A (this change) = DOCS/CONTRACT ONLY**: updated `decisions.md` (new doctrine entry),
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md` (semantics clarification + Codex wording request: drop "MHz @ mV",
  use "target" + "VF bin", keep measured voltage separate), `memory.md`, this file. **No backend
  code, no `apps/ui`, no apply/verify change, no F1b Phase 2B, no hardware.**
- **Open suspect (deferred, read-only-testable — Patch 11C, not started)**: offsets are computed as
  `target − GetStatus_base` and GetStatus under-reports freq at idle → a plateau applied at idle may
  land above `target` (consistent with observed ~1815–1830 MHz vs ~1785, on top of normal 15 MHz
  boost-bin quantization). To be confirmed by a future read-only live diagnostic — NOT changed here.
- **Does NOT block F1b Phase 2B** (it already keys on the VF bin + offset-readback VerifiedCurve
  gate); sequence the Codex copy fix + (optional) 11C live diagnostic before the supervised HW run.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — F1b Phase 2A: simulated multi-clock loop (DONE, not pushed)
- **`build_frontier(candidate_clocks, &FrontierDescent, &ForgePolicy, probe: impl Fn(u32,u32)->
  ProbeSample)`** in `gpu_power_sweep.rs` proves the multi-clock outer loop, per-target voltage-bin
  descent, stopping rules, known-unsafe boundary, frontier assembly, and synthesis wiring **without
  hardware**. The injected probe closure is the only seam to (future) hardware.
- **Loop rules**: descend from `safe_start_mv` by `voltage_step_mv`, never below `lowest_safe_mv`
  (known-crash floor as config); keep deepest stable; stop on first `Unstable`; stop/drop on
  simulated `curve_verified=false` (Phase-2B Patch-A gate); drop a clock with no stable point.
  Partial frontier allowed; empty → synthesis all-`None` (safe). Points record `vf_table_voltage_mv`
  (deterministic bin); measured voltage stays telemetry.
- **No hardware wired**: no `load_and_measure`, no `apply_vf_ceiling`, no VF write, no stress, no
  Safe Loop interaction, no real power sweep. New types/fn `#[cfg(windows)] #[allow(dead_code)]`.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` only. No IPC/persistence/`apps/ui` change.
  `cargo check` clean · service **52/52** (+8 sim; 3060 Ti 1830/1815/1740 + 4090 2880/2860/2700
  proven through the loop).
- **F1b Phase 2B (next, NOT started)**: fill the real probe closure — apply ceiling at the bin →
  Safe-Loop-armed `load_and_measure` dwell → offset-readback `VerifiedCurve` gate → map to
  `ProbeSample`; wire `build_frontier` into a **supervised/approval-gated** entry point; feed
  `candidate_clocks(...)` from a live `classify_regime`; add `target_clock_mhz` to points if needed.
- **Phase 3 (future)**: knowledge re-key to `(target_clock, vf_table_voltage_bin)` + global
  voltage-floor crash boundary; backward-compatible `gpu_knowledge.json` migration.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — F1b Phase 1: policy-driven multi-clock synthesis (DONE, pushed)
- Pure, service-internal in `gpu_power_sweep.rs`. **`ForgePolicy`** centralizes thresholds —
  Balanced `brokkrs_min_clock_frac=0.98` / `deep_calm_min_clock_frac=0.90` / `confidence_threshold=
  0.85`; Conservative (0.99/0.92/0.95) and Aggressive (0.97/0.85/0.70) presets.
- **`synthesize_forge_profiles(frontier, &ForgePolicy)`** now applies clock floors:
  Godforge = highest **sustainable** clock (prefers `p5_clock_mhz`, falls back to `clock_mhz`;
  ties→lowest power); **Brokkr's = max R within the Brokkr's clock floor** (real trade: clock<gc,
  power<gp); Deep Calm = max MHz/W within the Deep Calm floor. **Selection never uses measured
  voltage** — `vf_table_voltage_mv` stays the deterministic apply axis. **Single-clock collapse**
  detected + logged (still returns all three). **4090 doc ambiguity resolved: Brokkr's = 2860**
  (max-R-within-floor).
- Added Phase-2 helpers (pure, `#[allow(dead_code)]` until wired): `Regime` enum,
  `classify_regime(...)`, `candidate_clocks(...)`.
- **Files**: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` only. No IPC, no `apps/ui`, no Safe Loop,
  no hardware path. `cargo check` clean · service **44/44** (3 F1a tests unchanged + 9 F1b).
- **F1b Phase 2 (next, NOT started)**: real multi-clock measurement loop over the safe flatten
  sweep — build a **simulated/inject outer-loop scaffold first** (test loop/knowledge/stopping
  without a GPU), then a **supervised, approval-gated** hardware run; verify the ceiling per dwell
  (Patch A offset readback); SyntheticDwell context only; add `target_clock_mhz` to points then.
- **Phase 3**: re-key knowledge by (target_clock, vf_table_voltage_bin) + global voltage-floor
  crash boundary; backward-compatible `gpu_knowledge.json` migration.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — Forge action consolidation audit (recorded, no code change)
- Backend has **two engine generations**. **Canonical Forge GPU core path = `gpu_power_sweep.rs`
  (Power Sweep)**: `set_core_offset_mhz` + `apply_vf_ceiling` (elastic VF ceiling), game-power
  render dwell, Safe-Loop-guarded, **no voltage lock**. Apply via `ApplyPowerGodforge/Brokkrs/
  DeepCalm`. **F1b must extend ONLY this engine.**
- **Legacy (voltage-lock, TDR risk)**: `gpu_sweep_real.rs` (Real Sweep — `lock_core_voltage_mv`
  L239/L370, ALU load) and `gpu_forge_all.rs` (Forge Everything — fixed `CORE_VOLTAGE_MV=900`
  lock L193, VRAM around a fixed-voltage core) + the legacy `ApplyGodforge/Brokkrs/DeepCalm` trio.
  → hide from normal UI, schedule removal AFTER F1b. Keep IPC methods wired for now (no mid-stream
  break).
- **Memory/VRAM** (`gpu_mem_sweep.rs`): no core voltage lock, but runs independent of the forged
  core. **VRAM tuning remains future work and must adapt to the forged core curve** (run after
  core VF forge + validation, never define/destabilize it). Advanced Diagnostic until redesigned.
- **Action audit table + answers**: see this session's audit; frontend request in
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`; rationale in `decisions.md`. No code removed, no `apps/ui` change.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — Patch B load-state classification (IMPLEMENTED, pushed)
- Adds an orthogonal **LOAD axis** to `ApplyVerificationStatus`: `load_state: LoadVerification`
  (`NotEvaluated/VerifiedUnderLoad/TelemetryInsufficient/LoadMismatch/WorkloadStateMismatch
  (reserved)/LoadVerificationFailed`) + `load_reason`, `telemetry_match`, and diagnostic dwell
  fields (`p5_clock_mhz`, `min_clock_mhz`, `avg/min/max_measured_voltage_mv`,
  `voltage_sample_count`, `voltage_quality`, `telemetry_quality`). `status` stays the curve axis.
- **Source**: existing synthetic-dwell stats only — NO new stress run. `gpu_power_sweep::
  load_restored_progress()` (read-only, reads `forge_state.json`) → `find_applied_point` matches
  by label→named slot (Godforge/Brokkr's Best/Deep Calm) with a clock check, fallback = unique
  `points` entry; ambiguous→None. `classify_load`: curve must be VerifiedCurve; `p5_clock ≥
  target−30 MHz` (two bins) AND `telemetry_quality ≥ Medium` → VerifiedUnderLoad; voltage is
  telemetry-only (implausible→TelemetryInsufficient); `stable=false`→LoadMismatch; bad power→
  LoadVerificationFailed; missing p5/quality→TelemetryInsufficient. `effective_status` derivation:
  load upgrades VerifiedCurve→VerifiedUnderLoad, never downgrades; LiveMismatch stays LiveMismatch.
- **Files**: `crates/core/src/ipc.rs` (LoadVerification + fields), `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`
  (find_applied_point, classify_load, effective_status, fill_load_axis, tests),
  `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs` (load_restored_progress), `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`.
  Additive only; `verify-applied` stays read-only.
- **Tests**: check clean · service 35/35 (+10 load tests).
- **Runtime QA** (`verify-applied`, read-only): curve=VerifiedCurve(63/65), forge_state loaded
  (17 pts), matched Brokkr's slot, **load_state=TelemetryInsufficient** ("legacy point without
  dwell quality" — the persisted point predates the richer-dwell-stats patch), status=verified_curve.
  No writes (`gpu_applied.json` + `forge_state.json` mtimes unchanged). To get VerifiedUnderLoad a
  fresh sweep (HW, supervised) must produce a point carrying the new dwell stats.
- **Limitations**: WorkloadStateMismatch reserved (live real-game context = future); load axis only
  as good as the persisted dwell stats. **Next: Forge Action Consolidation.**

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-06) — Applied curve verifier, Patch A (IMPLEMENTED, pushed)
- **Read-only `VerifyAppliedProfile` IPC** + new `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`. Answers
  "does the live modern VF curve match the applied profile?" → `CurveVerification` =
  `NotApplicable | MetadataOnly | VerifiedCurve | LiveMismatch | VerificationFailed`.
- **Table-to-table only**: re-derives the deterministic ceiling bin the same way apply does
  (`nearest_vf_bin_at_or_above(core.voltage_mv)` — NOT measured voltage); reads
  `read_vf_curve_modern` (GetStatus) + `vf_get_point_khz` (offset corroboration, logged only).
  Rule: points with `mv ≥ ceiling` should read `target ±15 MHz`; ≥90% match (and ≥1) →
  VerifiedCurve, else LiveMismatch; empty/unmappable → VerificationFailed.
- **Read-only**: never applies/reapplies/writes/stresses. Patch B (telemetry/load),
  Patch C (workload context, stock fingerprint, ExternalUnknown) NOT implemented.
- **Files**: `crates/core/src/ipc.rs` (enum `CurveVerification`, `ApplyVerificationStatus`,
  `VerifyAppliedProfile` request, `ApplyVerification` response), `crates/service/src/gpu_verify.rs`,
  `main.rs` (mod), `ipc_server.rs` (handler), `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`. Additive only.
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · service 26/26 (+7 verifier pure tests).
- **Read-only runtime path (2026-06-06)**: added console subcommand
  `nidavellir-service.exe verify-applied` (`run_verify_only` in `main.rs`) — runs the verifier
  with NO `run_startup_recovery`/`spawn_heartbeat`/`reapply_on_boot`/pipe server, so **no apply,
  no VF write**. Prints `ApplyVerificationStatus` JSON + the `apply_verify:` log. Proven
  non-mutating (`gpu_applied.json` mtime unchanged across a run).
- **Patch A.1 — offset-based verification (2026-06-06) — DONE**: runtime QA proved GetStatus
  actual-freq is unreliable at idle (under-reported the plateau 31/65 while the flatten offsets
  were resident 63/65). `classify_curve` now gates on the **GET-control offset readback**
  (`vf_get_point_khz`): a point ≥ ceiling counts as flattened if it carries a **non-zero** offset
  (presence, not exact value — per-point stock base isn't persisted); ≥90% → VerifiedCurve;
  unreadable offsets → VerificationFailed (safer than mismatch). GetStatus freq match stays a
  logged diagnostic (`getstatus_freq_match=...`). Re-ran `verify-applied` → **VerifiedCurve**
  (offset_match 63/65, getstatus 31/65), no write (`gpu_applied.json` mtime unchanged). Service
  25/25, check clean. **Known caveat**: presence-only offset check can't yet distinguish a
  Nidavellir flatten from an external tool's offsets (ExternalUnknown = Patch C); and it can't
  detect an offset that's present but wrong-valued (would need persisted stock base).
- **Unblocks**: Patch B (load classification) can reuse the applied `PowerSweepPoint` dwell stats.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-05) — Richer dwell stats (IMPLEMENTED, pushed)
- Second patch off the Sensor Audit. **`PowerSweepPoint` gains optional dwell-quality
  fields**: `min_clock_mhz`/`p5_clock_mhz`, measured-voltage `avg/min/max` +
  `voltage_sample_count`, `dwell_sample_count`/`dwell_duration_ms`, `start/end/avg_temp_c`,
  and `voltage_quality`/`telemetry_quality` (new `DwellQuality` enum in `core/ipc.rs`:
  high/medium/low/unavailable).
- **Voltage stats are ramp-filtered + sanity-checked (500–1250 mV)**; the legacy unfiltered
  voltage max (`volt_mv` → `voltage_mv`/`measured_voltage_mv` + the apply-key snap) is
  **UNCHANGED** (restriction: don't touch the apply-key decision). min/p5 clock from the
  retained post-ramp clock samples; temp from NVML per-sample reads. Per-point
  `dwell_stats:` log line (not per-sample).
- **Files**: `crates/core/src/ipc.rs`, `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`. No `apps/ui`, Safe Loop, synthesis, or F1b change.
  Additive serde-default fields; `PowerSweepPoint` stays `Copy`; old `forge_state.json` loads.
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · core 44/44 · service 19/19.
- **Limitations (next work)**: full NVML limiter reasons deferred (needs `NvmlGpuReading`
  in core); voltage cadence still ~480 ms (≈Medium quality, now surfaced); no per-sample
  timestamps; no hotspot/fan; `arduous_validate` soak path doesn't yet use the richer stats.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-05) — Voltage field separation (IMPLEMENTED, pushed)
- First patch off the Sensor Audit decision. **`PowerSweepPoint` now separates
  `measured_voltage_mv` (telemetry) from `vf_table_voltage_mv` (deterministic apply/
  frontier key)**; legacy `voltage_mv` retained for compat/display.
- **Apply path snaps measured voltage → real VF-table bin** (`nearest_vf_bin_at_or_above`
  in gpu-nvapi; `choose_ceiling_mv` in `gpu_apply.rs`) **before `apply_vf_ceiling`** — no
  longer keys the ceiling on raw measured voltage. Logs `voltage_semantics: …`.
- **Backward-compatible**: no schema bump; old `forge_state.json`/`PowerSweepPoint` JSON
  loads new optional fields as `None`; `VfPoint`/`gpu_applied.json` unchanged → apply
  re-snaps at runtime (legacy warning only if the live curve is empty). Additive IPC
  fields documented in `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`.
- **Files**: `crates/gpu-nvapi/src/lib.rs`, `crates/core/src/ipc.rs`,
  `crates/service/src/gpu_apply.rs`, `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`,
  `docs/contracts/ui-backend.md`. No `apps/ui`, Safe Loop, or synthesis change.
- **Tests**: `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` clean · gpu-nvapi 5/5 · service 15/15.
- **Limitations (next work)**: frequency-only flatten unchanged; the ~1062 mV unfocused/
  desktop state is NOT solved here; richer dwell stats + applied-curve verification pending.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-05) — Sensor Quality Audit (Review 2, investigation-only)
- **No code/IPC/UI change.** GPU telemetry sources are right (NVML clock/power/cap/temp/
  util; NVAPI curve). Three structural gaps found:
  1. **Two disconnected telemetry worlds**: "sensor world" (`SensorEngine`/`GpuSensors`,
     **30 s cache, `voltage_mv` hardcoded `None`** → UI never gets GPU voltage) vs
     "sweep world" (`load_and_measure`, NVML 30 ms + NVAPI voltage ~480 ms, stored as
     `fetch_max`). Nothing reconciles them.
  2. **Voltage is the weakest signal**: NVAPI `core_voltage()` **string-parsed**, sparse,
     **max-only**, ramp-unfiltered — then **reused as the deterministic `apply_vf_ceiling`
     threshold** (`PowerSweepPoint.voltage_mv` → `AppliedProfile.core.voltage_mv` →
     `ceiling_mv`). This is the root of 837-vs-869 and makes apply fidelity unprovable.
  3. **One name, three meanings**: `voltage_mv` on `PowerSweepPoint` (measured max),
     `VfCurvePoint`/GetStatus (VF-table), `AppliedProfile.core` (measured, consumed as
     curve threshold).
- **KEY DECISION (see `decisions.md`)**: split voltage into **`vf_table_voltage_mv`**
  (deterministic, the **apply/frontier key**) · **`measured_voltage_mv`** avg/min/max
  (telemetry + HWiNFO cross-check only, never an apply key) · **`effective_rail_voltage_mv`**
  (future). **F1b must NOT key on measured dwell voltage.**
- **Verdicts NOT finalized**: 837-vs-869 ≈ undersampling + bin quantization (expected,
  not apply failure); constant ~1062 mV unfocused/desktop ≈ workload-scoped (P0/3D)
  ceiling leaving other states on stock curve + frequency-only flatten leaving voltage
  uncapped. To be confirmed by the verification work.
- **Other gaps**: perf-limiter only reads `SW_POWER_CAP` (NVML exposes the full
  `ThrottleReasons` set — thermal/voltage/util discarded); no timestamps/p5-clock-dip
  stats; no workload-context tag; no cross-validation (0 mV / 0 W dropouts stored as real).
- **Post-audit sequencing** (F1b stays on hold until 1–3 land): (1) split voltage fields +
  stop keying apply on measured voltage [must-fix]; (2) richer dwell stats + full limiter +
  context tag; (3) finalize Applied Curve Verification (table-to-table GetStatus plateau,
  not vs measured voltage) + verify IPC + `GpuApplyStatus.verification`; (4) F1b on the
  cleaned axis.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-05) — Applied Curve Verification review (investigation-only)
- **No code change.** Apply is **write-and-forget** (`apply_core` logs flattened count,
  no readback). `GetAppliedProfile` is **metadata-only** (`gpu_applied.json`, no live
  driver check) — "Applied ✓" = file exists, not curve verified. Verification must use
  the **modern ClkVfPoints GetStatus** path (`read_vf_curve_modern`), not legacy
  `read_curve`/`GetGpuCurve`. The flatten caps **frequency, not voltage** — a high VF bin
  can still be selected. Primitive for verification already exists (`read_vf_curve_modern`),
  just unwired. Feeds directly into the sensor-audit sequencing above.

## Backend checkpoint (2026-06-05) — forge-state persistence
- **F1b is on hold** pending two foundation reviews; cheap lower-clock probe plan is
  NOT approved. Both reviews (persistence/startup + sensor quality) are now done.
- **Shipped**: `forge_state.json` (under `%ProgramData%\Nidavellir`) persists the final
  `PowerSweepProgress` on successful sweep completion (only when a profile exists, so a
  failed sweep can't wipe a good snapshot). Startup seeds `PowerSweepHandle` from it when
  the GPU key (`read_curve().name`) matches; else idle. Fixes a service restart losing
  forged profiles/points/apply buttons. Files: `crates/service/src/gpu_power_sweep.rs`
  (+ `main.rs`, `service_impl.rs` seed both startup paths). Backend-only — no UI, IPC,
  Safe Loop, synthesis, or `gpu_knowledge.json` change.
- **Validation**: `cargo test -p nidavellir-service` → 11/11 pass;
  `cargo check -p nidavellir-service` → no warnings. No GPU stress run.
- **Remaining foundation work (in order)**:
  a) manual restart verification (apply a profile → restart service → UI still shows it);
  b) **must-fix**: split voltage fields (`vf_table_voltage_mv` / `measured_voltage_mv` /
     `effective_rail_voltage_mv`) + stop keying `apply_vf_ceiling` on measured voltage;
  c) richer dwell stats (min/p5 clock, voltage avg/min/max, full `ThrottleReasons`,
     sample_count, timestamps, workload-context tag);
  d) finalize Applied Curve Verification (post-apply GetStatus plateau readback,
     table-to-table; verify IPC + `GpuApplyStatus.verification`);
  e) F1b redesign — only after b–d land and the direction is confirmed; key the frontier
     by (clock + VF-table point), NOT measured voltage.

## Where things stand
- **Brokkr's V1 (continuous per-GPU knowledge): implemented + HW-validated.**
- **V2 (confidence-gated selection): committed (5d72342).** `cargo test` 3/3. The
  gate is now reused as the confidence axis for all 3 product profiles.
- **Product reframe (this session, see `product.md`)**: 3 profiles forged from a
  clock×power frontier. **F1a done** — pure `synthesize_forge_profiles` + tests
  (6/6), not yet wired. **F1b** = produce the real multi-clock frontier.
- Architecture finding: two overlapping sweep engines (safe flatten vs unsafe
  lock-voltage frontier); F1b builds on the flatten one — tech debt to consolidate.
- Last supervised sweep explored to **+210 offset (~881 mV)** with NO crash and
  found Brokkr's = **1830 MHz @ 881 mV · 179 W · 10.24 MHz/W (off-cap)** — essentially
  the user's hand-tuned 1800 MHz @ 875 mV. Godforge = stock max-voltage point.
- GPU is at **stock**; service + UI were running; Safe Loop baseline is clean.

## Build / run (from repo root C:\Users\leona\dev\nidavellir)
- Build service: `cargo build --release -p nidavellir-service`
  (STOP the service first or the .exe is locked:
  `Get-Process nidavellir-service | Stop-Process -Force`).
- Run service (headless): `./target/release/nidavellir-service.exe console`
  (logs → `target/svc.log`).
- Run UI: `cd apps/ui && npm run tauri:dev`.
- Headless control (named-pipe client): `scripts/ipc.ps1 -Method <Name>`:
  `StartPowerSweep` / `GetPowerSweepProgress` / `StopPowerSweep` /
  `ResetGpuTuning` / `ApplyPowerBrokkrs` / `GetGpuCurve` / `GetSafeLoopStatus`.

## Learned knowledge (C:\ProgramData\Nidavellir\gpu_knowledge.json)
- `boundary`: highest_clean **210**, lowest_reboot **255** (silent_error/tdr null).
- 15 per-offset PointStats (0→210), 1 trial each, 0 failures.
- Next sweep's data-driven ceiling = **+240** (~870 mV), then it CONVERGES (cap
  ABS_MAX_OFFSET=240; never re-touches the 255 reboot).

## Pending / next actions
1. **Commit F1a** (synthesis + tests + `product.md`/decisions/roadmap) once reviewed.
2. **F1b**: extend the safe flatten sweep to several target clocks → real game-power
   clock×power frontier; knowledge keying by (clock, offset); wire
   `synthesize_forge_profiles` in (replaces the single-clock godforge/brokkrs picks).
3. Then F2–F7 (see `product.md`).
4. In-game apply test (`ApplyPowerBrokkrs`) — consistency in Overwatch; user present.

## Gotchas / safety
- **Deep undervolt can HARD-REBOOT** (not just TDR). +255/~855 mV did. Never
  auto-run deep exploration — supervised only. The knowledge bounds the search.
- The render is **heavier than real games**, so it destabilizes at a higher voltage
  than games → the validated point is conservative (good), but probing near the
  frontier under it still risks a reboot.
- **In-sweep a hard reboot does NOT auto-update `gpu_knowledge.json`** (only
  SilentError/TDR do). After a reboot, read the Safe Loop `boot_flag.json` offset
  and set `lowest_reboot` in the knowledge manually (until the integration lands).
- Rebuilding requires stopping the running service (file lock).
- Run-to-run thermal variance: start sweeps on a cool GPU for representative numbers.
