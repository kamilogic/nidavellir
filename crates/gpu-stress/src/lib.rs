//! Real GPU compute-validation battery (wgpu / Vulkan).
//!
//! Detects instability by **wrong results** (silent errors), not just crashes
//! (roadmap §12). The battery covers distinct failure modes so it doesn't need
//! a specific game to surface them:
//!   - **ALU** — known-answer LCG, heavy integer mul/add → core stability.
//!   - **Memory** — many pseudo-random gathers from a table → memory subsystem.
//!   - **Burst** — the ALU load in on/off bursts → dI/dt power transients
//!     (what bursty game frametimes hit and a steady stress misses).
//!
//! Every stage has a bit-exact CPU reference; any divergence ⇒ `SilentError`,
//! a device-lost ⇒ `Crash`.
